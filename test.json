Gamers especially flocked to the frame rate as it allowed for jutter-free playback of fast-paced titles like <em><a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2015/04/09/call-of-duty-black-ops-3-teaser/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\">Call of Duty</a></em> or<em> <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2015/03/13/titanfall-sequel-headed-to-more-than-just-xbox-and-windows/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\">Titanfall</a></em>.

The new frame rate is still an early preview, mind you, and will only be available on HTML5-compatible browsers. However, YouTube will encode these streams in both 720p60 and 1080p60 formats as well as automatically knock it down to 30FPS for devices that can't handle full speed.</p>\n\n<div></div>\nWhat's more, YouTube is also rolling out HTML5 playback which will enable viewers to not only rewind in the middle of a live stream but also play it back at up to double speed in order to catch back up to the broadcast. And for producers, the video-sharing site has collaborated with Elgato and XSplit to ensure that products like <a href=\"https://www.elgato.com/gaming/download\">Elgato Game Capture</a>, <a href=\"https://www.xsplit.com/blog/xsplit-broadcaster-and-xsplit-gamecaster-v2-3-are-now-available\">XSplit Broadcaster</a> and <a href=\"https://www.xsplit.com/blog/xsplit-broadcaster-and-xsplit-gamecaster-v2-3-are-now-available\">XSplit Gamecaster</a> will continue to work with the site.\n<p>Filed under: <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/category/displays/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\" rel=\"tag\">Displays</a>, <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/category/google/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\" rel=\"tag\">Google</a></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2015/05/21/youtube-now-supports-60-fps-live-streaming/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget#comments\">Comments</a></strong></p>",

Its very own cow manure-powered model, dubbed \"Bus Hound,\" <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-berkshire-32801974\">ran the track</a> at nearly 77mph -- shattering the previous world mark of zero mph, because poo-bus records are not actually a thing.

Reading's chief engineer said \"we wanted to get the image of bus transport away from being dirty, smelly and slow.\" Nevertheless, he added that \"it sounded like a Vulcan bomber -- the aerodynamics aren't designed for going 80mph.\" The mark stands as some kind of record for methane powered service buses, but it would have to top 150mph to get a Guinness World Record, according to the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-berkshire-32801974\"><em>BBC</em></a>.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"></p>\n<p>Filed under: <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/category/transportation/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\" rel=\"tag\">Transportation</a></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2015/05/21/manure-powered-bus-speed-record-poo-yeah/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget#comments\">Comments</a></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-berkshire-32801974http://\">BBC News</a></p>",

A software update rolling out to all Sky+HD boxes this week will put a new \"Kids\" tile on the homepage, providing instant access to on-demand shows and movies, kids TV recordings and live channels such as Cbeebies and Nick Jr. In addition, Sky is expanding its library of on-demand episodes from 700 to 4,000 over the coming months. It'll include new morsels of <em>SpongeBob Squarepants</em>, <em>Dora the Explorer</em> and <em>Ben 10</em>, as well as cult favourite <em>Adventure Time</em>. YouTube appeals because it's (mostly) free, but if you've been stressed out before trying to find a decent clip online, you might want to try grabbing your Sky remote next time.</p>\n\n<p>Filed under: <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/category/home-entertainment/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\" rel=\"tag\">Home Entertainment</a></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2015/05/21/sky-kids-netflix/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget#comments\">Comments</a></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href=\"https://corporate.sky.com/media-centre/news-page/2015/the-abc-of-kids-tv--sky-adding-thousands-of-episodes-of-kids-tv-to-on-demand-service\">Sky</a></p>",

Together with Google, it launched Code as a Second Language (CSL) courses in eight cities, including New York, Las Angeles and Miami. The idea is to introduce students to coding through 1-2 hour sessions, then steer them to the <a href=\"http://www.loftcsl.org/\">LOFT</a> (Latinos on Fast Track) network for ongoing online instruction. Students who complete that training could later be granted internships and possibly full-time positions with Fortune 500 companies.</p>\n<p>Volunteers or teachers learn to train kids on basic coding through a program called CS First. Google and the HHF plan to implement the CSL program in 30 additional LA schools later on, and launch pilot CSL programs at the Mexican consulates in San Jose and Washington, DC. Meanwhile, schools interested in the program can sign up <a href=\"http://www.loftcsl.org/school_signup\">here</a>, and volunteers instructors can enlist at <a href=\"http://www.loftcsl.org/volunteer_signup\">this link</a>. Google also runs the <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2014/06/19/google-aims-to-inspire-girls-to-code-with-new-initiative/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\">Made with Code</a> program for girls and obviously has some self-interest in developing programmers (as does Apple, which just launched its <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2015/03/10/apple-diversity-efforts/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\">own initiative</a>). But given that only 1 in 10 US schools teach coding, along with the lack of women and minorities in tech, the efforts are certainly welcome.</p>\n\n<p>[Image credit: Televisa Foundation]</p>\n<p>Filed under: <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/category/internet/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\" rel=\"tag\">Internet</a>, <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/category/software/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\" rel=\"tag\">Software</a>, <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/category/google/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\" rel=\"tag\">Google</a></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2015/05/21/google-code-as-a-second-language/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget#comments\">Comments</a></strong></p>",

D'Agostino, Gourmet Garage and Billy's Bakery are the first companies on board, offering groceries, cooked meals and freshly baked cupcakes respectively alongside Amazon's own range of goods. The online retailer is starting small but plans to add more stores across Manhattan over time, with Italian food market Eataly and Westside Market already waiting in the wings.

Well apparently, that kind of face-tracking tech already exists. Facebook's <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2015/05/19/oculus-mobile-jam-vr-finalists/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\">Oculus division</a> has teamed up with University of Southern California researchers to develop a way to track your facial expressions while wearing a <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2015/05/06/early-2016-oculus-rift-consumer/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\">chunky VR headset</a>. What they did was insert strain gauges within the the Rift's foam padding to monitor the movements of the upper part of your face. To monitor the lower part not covered by the headset, they attached a 3D camera to a short boom clipped to the center of the Rift. As you can see in the video below the fold, a virtual avatar successfully mimicked the expressions of their testers with that setup.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center\"><iframe allowFullScreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"384\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/rgKkEnaaSDc?rel=0&amp;wmode=opaque\" width=\"630\"></iframe></div>\n\n<p>Project lead Hao Li believes the technology could make it more compelling to interact with others in virtual words; talking face to face, even as avatars, feels a lot more personal than text chats, after all.

Researchers at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory have <a href=\"https://www.llnl.gov/news/american-energy-use-slightly-carbon-emissions-almost-unchanged-0\">determined</a> that Americans' energy use climbed 1 percent year-over-year in 2014, but its carbon emissions hardly budged at all. In fact, they were down significantly for coal and petroleum-based power. While some of that decline is due to industry using less-than-clean natural gas, it's also helped by big jumps in <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2015/05/09/current-solar-power-tech-is-good-enough/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\">solar</a> and <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2015/01/16/new-york-city-wind-turbine/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\">wind</a> energy, which respectively grew by 33 and 8 percent.</p>\n<p>These eco-friendly sources still represent just a tiny piece of the puzzle at 2.2 percent of the US' entire demand, so there's no doubt that dirty power still dominates. Scientists are quick to add that green tech is running into roadblocks, as well -- wind turbine deployments have slowed down in the past two years, and California's drought shrank the use of hydroelectric power. All the same, it's evident that environmentally conscious electricity is significant enough to mitigate the US' damage to the planet.</p>\n\n<p>[Image credit: AP Photo/John Raoux]</p>\n<p>Filed under: <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/category/science/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\" rel=\"tag\">Science</a></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2015/05/21/us-study-shows-green-power-effect/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget#comments\">Comments</a></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.llnl.gov/news/american-energy-use-slightly-carbon-emissions-almost-unchanged-0\">Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory</a></p>",

Whoever has the best proposal will (hopefully) craft systems that not only prevent enemies from getting in, but bounce back quickly if the worst happens.</p>\n<p>As you might suspect, this effort faces a few challenges.  Besides the inherent optimism behind creating hack-resistant tech -- the odds are that <em>someone</em> will find a way in -- the Navy won't even start reviewing proposals until May 2016.  That likely leaves at least a few years before these more resilient robotic warriors are flying over hostile waters.  Even so, it's good to see that future connected drones will be built from the start with network security in mind.</p>\n\n<p>[Image credit: AP Photo/Steve Helber]</p>\n<p>Filed under: <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/category/robots/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\" rel=\"tag\">Robots</a></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2015/05/20/us-navy-wants-hack-resistant-drones/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget#comments\">Comments</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Via:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.nextgov.com/cybersecurity/2015/05/who-knows-if-navy-drones-and-airborne-weapons-are-hackable/113134/?oref=ng-HPtopstory\">Nextgov</a>, <a href=\"http://www.defenseone.com/technology/2015/05/navy-trying-hack-proof-its-drones/113311/\">Defense One</a></p>\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;id=6dd007eb4561583a583d66658e8f3c16&amp;tab=core&amp;_cview=0\">FedBizOpps.gov</a></p>",

And while Lycos hasn't made many headlines lately, the company still maintains an impressive portfolio of technology patents. Its patents are wide-ranging enough that Google already got into trouble over old Lycos tech <a href=\"http://hamptonroads.com/2012/11/norfolk-jury-awards-30-million-small-tech-company\">back in 2012</a> before winning its case on an appeal <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-08-15/vringo-loses-appeals-court-ruling-in-google-patent-case-1-\">last year</a>.

The technology, known as an Implanted MyoElectric Sensor (IMES) will allow users to move the company's motorized Proprio Foot just like they do <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2015/04/01/thinking-cap-controls-prosthetic-arm-with-thoughts-not-surger/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\">the real thing</a>.</p>\n<p>With an existing analog (or even powered) prosthesis, there&#39;s often an infuriating lag between intention and action because the user has to physically contract a muscle to activate it. Not so with the IMES system. When electrical signals from the user&#39;s brain hit the end of the amputated leg, they&#39;re picked up by a pair of sensors embedded in the surrounding muscle tissue. These sensors, in turn, send a wireless signal to the Proprio foot telling it to flex or extend. And since the muscles themselves aren&#39;t contracting, there&#39;s no lag between thinking about moving and actually doing so. What&#39;s more, the implantation surgery only takes about 15 minutes and requires an single single-centimeter-long incision. Even cooler is the fact that the sensors are powered by tiny magnetic coils housed in the prosthetic socket so they won&#39;t have to be replaced once installed. &quot;We believe this is a lifelong sensor,&quot; Thorvaldur Ingvarsson, Ossur&#39;s head of R&amp;D, told <a href=\"http://www.popsci.com/brain-controlled-bionic-legs-are-here-no-really\"><em>Popular Science</em></a>.</p>\n\n<p>\"It's really surreal,\" Gudmundur Olafsson, one of the the company's two initial test subjects, said in a statement. \"The first time, to be honest, I started to cry. You are moving the ankle, and I basically haven't had one in 11 years.\" Olafsson spent 14 months using the IMES-enabled Proprio as his sole prosthetic.</p>\n\n<p>Up next, the company plans to hold large-scale clinical trials and hopes to have the device to market within the next three to five years. There's no word yet on how much the devices will cost once they do become available.</p>\n<p>Filed under: <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/category/wearables/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\" rel=\"tag\">Wearables</a>, <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/category/wireless/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\" rel=\"tag\">Wireless</a>, <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/category/science/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\" rel=\"tag\">Science</a></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2015/05/20/prosthetic-foot-mind-control/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget#comments\">Comments</a></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.popsci.com/brain-controlled-bionic-legs-are-here-no-really\">Popular Science</a></p>",

These are the first products Google has released under its new Editions project, a series of collaborations with artists to develop limited edition \"live cases\" for select Android phones. For this batch, Mountain View worked with electronic dance music producer/DJ <a href=\"http://www.joystiq.com/2014/03/15/skrillex-advergame-takes-dubstep-to-the-stars/\">Skrillex</a>, who designed an outer space-inspired set. Now, here's the cool part: in keeping with the space theme, the products come with live wallpapers showing images of the Earth from the stratosphere during the day and constellations visible from your location at night. The tech giant actually launched a high-altitude balloon named after Skrillex's dog Nanou to capture images of our planet and didn't just take images from NASA.\n\n<p></p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center\"><iframe allowFullScreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"384\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/4x8_95bXTTE?rel=0&amp;wmode=opaque\" width=\"630\"></iframe></div>\n\n<p>In addition, the cases are built with a shortcut button -- it leads to the DJ's YouTube feed out of the box, but you can reprogram it to launch the camera or any other specific app. The Skrillex Editions cases are now up for sale on <a href=\"https://store.google.com/magazine/skrillex_live_case_magazine?utm_source=Google&amp;utm_medium=Blog&amp;utm_content=Android&amp;utm_campaign=LaunchDay\">Google Store</a> for the <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/lg/nexus/5/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\">Nexus 5</a>, <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/motorola/nexus/6/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\">Nexus 6</a>, <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/samsung/galaxy/s5/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\">Samsung Galaxy S5</a>, <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/samsung/galaxy/s6/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\">Samsung Galaxy S6</a> and <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/samsung/galaxy/note/4/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\">Samsung Galaxy Note 4</a>.

Two new studies may further confuse you about the benefits, with one concluding that gaming makes you friendlier in the real world, and another implying it could <em>ruin your brain</em>. First the plus side: <a href=\"http://today.ttu.edu/posts/2015/05/cooperative-video-game-play-elicits-pro-social-behavior\">Texas Tech</a> researchers think that cooperative gameplay, whether in violent or non-violent games, makes people nicer. \"We found that playing with a helpful partner increases the expectation of others to reciprocate that pro-social behavior,\" said author John Velez. He added that teaming up even makes you \"nicer to the other team... that just tried to beat you.\"</p>\n<p>Playing cooperatively, rather than alone -- even online -- can stimulate gamers' empathy so much that it negates the aggressive effects of violent games and even carries over into the real world. Velez found that players were more likely to help out pals in social situations and less likely to be <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2015/01/21/crash-ooverride-anti-gamergate/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\">hostile</a> to friend and foe alike. \"What we found was cooperative play seems to have the biggest effect in terms of decreasing aggression toward other people,\" he said.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>What we found was cooperative play seems to have the biggest effect in terms of decreasing aggression toward other people.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>On the downside, because of the way that gaming stimulates your brain, it may increase your risk to neurological disorders like Alzheimer&#39;s Disease. Researchers from the Douglas Institute and Université de Montréal <a href=\"http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2015-05/dmhu-ssn051915.php\">found</a> that gamers tend to navigate their environment using the brain's reward center (the caudate nucleas), rather than using spatial memory from the hippocampus like non-gamers. The results were hardly conclusive, and the team said that further studies should focus on specific games. But the study shows that while gaming may make you more <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2010/12/20/132077565/video-games-boost-brain-power-multitasking-skills\">attentive visually</a>, that might be outweighed by the negative effects on your brain.</p>\n<p>Filed under: <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/category/gaming/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\" rel=\"tag\">Gaming</a></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2015/05/20/gaming-cooperatively-makes-you-more-sociable/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget#comments\">Comments</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Via:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/05/150508105656.htm\">Science Daily</a></p>\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href=\"http://today.ttu.edu/posts/2015/05/cooperative-video-game-play-elicits-pro-social-behavior\">Texas Tech University</a>, <a href=\"http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2015-05/dmhu-ssn051915.php\">EurekAlert</a></p>",

The results? WordSmith was much faster, producing its piece in two minutes versus seven, but the writing was more than a little stiff -- it lacked the colorful expressions that made <em>NPR</em>&#39;s version easy to digest. With that said, newsies might not want to relax just yet.

The act disrupted more than 50 schools, bringing everything from payroll to standardized tests grinding to a halt.

If found guilty, the unnamed individual is likely to serve up to 180 days in jail, as well as being expelled from school. In addition, the suspect's parents are going to be asked to pay for the financial losses suffered as a consequence of the attack. At the same time, a middle school student is also under investigation for attempting a similar attack shortly afterward.

Together with Google, it launched Code as a Second Language (CSL) courses in eight cities, including New York, Las Angeles and Miami. The idea is to introduce students to coding through 1-2 hour sessions, then steer them to the <a href=\"http://www.loftcsl.org/\">LOFT</a> (Latinos on Fast Track) network for ongoing online instruction. Students who complete that training could later be granted internships and possibly full-time positions with Fortune 500 companies.</p>\n<p>Volunteers or teachers learn to train kids on basic coding through a program called CS First. Google and the HHF plan to implement the CSL program in 30 additional LA schools later on, and launch pilot CSL programs at the Mexican consulates in San Jose and Washington, DC. Meanwhile, schools interested in the program can sign up <a href=\"http://www.loftcsl.org/school_signup\">here</a>, and volunteers instructors can enlist at <a href=\"http://www.loftcsl.org/volunteer_signup\">this link</a>. Google also runs the <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2014/06/19/google-aims-to-inspire-girls-to-code-with-new-initiative/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\">Made with Code</a> program for girls and obviously has some self-interest in developing programmers (as does Apple, which just launched its <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2015/03/10/apple-diversity-efforts/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\">own initiative</a>). But given that only 1 in 10 US schools teach coding, along with the lack of women and minorities in tech, the efforts are certainly welcome.</p>\n\n<p>[Image credit: Televisa Foundation]</p>\n<p>Filed under: <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/category/internet/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\" rel=\"tag\">Internet</a>, <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/category/software/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\" rel=\"tag\">Software</a>, <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/category/google/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\" rel=\"tag\">Google</a></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2015/05/21/google-code-as-a-second-language/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget#comments\">Comments</a></strong></p>",

What they did was insert strain gauges within the the Rift's foam padding to monitor the movements of the upper part of your face. To monitor the lower part not covered by the headset, they attached a 3D camera to a short boom clipped to the center of the Rift. As you can see in the video below the fold, a virtual avatar successfully mimicked the expressions of their testers with that setup.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center\"><iframe allowFullScreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"384\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/rgKkEnaaSDc?rel=0&amp;wmode=opaque\" width=\"630\"></iframe></div>\n\n<p>Project lead Hao Li believes the technology could make it more compelling to interact with others in virtual words; talking face to face, even as avatars, feels a lot more personal than text chats, after all.

Researchers at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory have <a href=\"https://www.llnl.gov/news/american-energy-use-slightly-carbon-emissions-almost-unchanged-0\">determined</a> that Americans' energy use climbed 1 percent year-over-year in 2014, but its carbon emissions hardly budged at all. In fact, they were down significantly for coal and petroleum-based power. While some of that decline is due to industry using less-than-clean natural gas, it's also helped by big jumps in <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2015/05/09/current-solar-power-tech-is-good-enough/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\">solar</a> and <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2015/01/16/new-york-city-wind-turbine/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\">wind</a> energy, which respectively grew by 33 and 8 percent.</p>\n<p>These eco-friendly sources still represent just a tiny piece of the puzzle at 2.2 percent of the US' entire demand, so there's no doubt that dirty power still dominates. Scientists are quick to add that green tech is running into roadblocks, as well -- wind turbine deployments have slowed down in the past two years, and California's drought shrank the use of hydroelectric power. All the same, it's evident that environmentally conscious electricity is significant enough to mitigate the US' damage to the planet.</p>\n\n<p>[Image credit: AP Photo/John Raoux]</p>\n<p>Filed under: <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/category/science/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\" rel=\"tag\">Science</a></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2015/05/21/us-study-shows-green-power-effect/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget#comments\">Comments</a></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.llnl.gov/news/american-energy-use-slightly-carbon-emissions-almost-unchanged-0\">Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory</a></p>",

Whoever has the best proposal will (hopefully) craft systems that not only prevent enemies from getting in, but bounce back quickly if the worst happens.</p>\n<p>As you might suspect, this effort faces a few challenges.  Besides the inherent optimism behind creating hack-resistant tech -- the odds are that <em>someone</em> will find a way in -- the Navy won't even start reviewing proposals until May 2016.  That likely leaves at least a few years before these more resilient robotic warriors are flying over hostile waters.  Even so, it's good to see that future connected drones will be built from the start with network security in mind.</p>\n\n<p>[Image credit: AP Photo/Steve Helber]</p>\n<p>Filed under: <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/category/robots/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\" rel=\"tag\">Robots</a></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2015/05/20/us-navy-wants-hack-resistant-drones/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget#comments\">Comments</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Via:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.nextgov.com/cybersecurity/2015/05/who-knows-if-navy-drones-and-airborne-weapons-are-hackable/113134/?oref=ng-HPtopstory\">Nextgov</a>, <a href=\"http://www.defenseone.com/technology/2015/05/navy-trying-hack-proof-its-drones/113311/\">Defense One</a></p>\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;id=6dd007eb4561583a583d66658e8f3c16&amp;tab=core&amp;_cview=0\">FedBizOpps.gov</a></p>",

The technology, known as an Implanted MyoElectric Sensor (IMES) will allow users to move the company's motorized Proprio Foot just like they do <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2015/04/01/thinking-cap-controls-prosthetic-arm-with-thoughts-not-surger/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\">the real thing</a>.</p>\n<p>With an existing analog (or even powered) prosthesis, there&#39;s often an infuriating lag between intention and action because the user has to physically contract a muscle to activate it. Not so with the IMES system. When electrical signals from the user&#39;s brain hit the end of the amputated leg, they&#39;re picked up by a pair of sensors embedded in the surrounding muscle tissue. These sensors, in turn, send a wireless signal to the Proprio foot telling it to flex or extend. And since the muscles themselves aren&#39;t contracting, there&#39;s no lag between thinking about moving and actually doing so. What&#39;s more, the implantation surgery only takes about 15 minutes and requires an single single-centimeter-long incision. Even cooler is the fact that the sensors are powered by tiny magnetic coils housed in the prosthetic socket so they won&#39;t have to be replaced once installed. &quot;We believe this is a lifelong sensor,&quot; Thorvaldur Ingvarsson, Ossur&#39;s head of R&amp;D, told <a href=\"http://www.popsci.com/brain-controlled-bionic-legs-are-here-no-really\"><em>Popular Science</em></a>.</p>\n\n<p>\"It's really surreal,\" Gudmundur Olafsson, one of the the company's two initial test subjects, said in a statement. \"The first time, to be honest, I started to cry. You are moving the ankle, and I basically haven't had one in 11 years.\" Olafsson spent 14 months using the IMES-enabled Proprio as his sole prosthetic.</p>\n\n<p>Up next, the company plans to hold large-scale clinical trials and hopes to have the device to market within the next three to five years. There's no word yet on how much the devices will cost once they do become available.</p>\n<p>Filed under: <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/category/wearables/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\" rel=\"tag\">Wearables</a>, <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/category/wireless/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\" rel=\"tag\">Wireless</a>, <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/category/science/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\" rel=\"tag\">Science</a></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2015/05/20/prosthetic-foot-mind-control/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget#comments\">Comments</a></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.popsci.com/brain-controlled-bionic-legs-are-here-no-really\">Popular Science</a></p>",

Now, here's the cool part: in keeping with the space theme, the products come with live wallpapers showing images of the Earth from the stratosphere during the day and constellations visible from your location at night. The tech giant actually launched a high-altitude balloon named after Skrillex's dog Nanou to capture images of our planet and didn't just take images from NASA.\n\n<p></p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center\"><iframe allowFullScreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"384\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/4x8_95bXTTE?rel=0&amp;wmode=opaque\" width=\"630\"></iframe></div>\n\n<p>In addition, the cases are built with a shortcut button -- it leads to the DJ's YouTube feed out of the box, but you can reprogram it to launch the camera or any other specific app. The Skrillex Editions cases are now up for sale on <a href=\"https://store.google.com/magazine/skrillex_live_case_magazine?utm_source=Google&amp;utm_medium=Blog&amp;utm_content=Android&amp;utm_campaign=LaunchDay\">Google Store</a> for the <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/lg/nexus/5/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\">Nexus 5</a>, <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/motorola/nexus/6/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\">Nexus 6</a>, <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/samsung/galaxy/s5/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\">Samsung Galaxy S5</a>, <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/samsung/galaxy/s6/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\">Samsung Galaxy S6</a> and <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/samsung/galaxy/note/4/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\">Samsung Galaxy Note 4</a>.

Two new studies may further confuse you about the benefits, with one concluding that gaming makes you friendlier in the real world, and another implying it could <em>ruin your brain</em>. First the plus side: <a href=\"http://today.ttu.edu/posts/2015/05/cooperative-video-game-play-elicits-pro-social-behavior\">Texas Tech</a> researchers think that cooperative gameplay, whether in violent or non-violent games, makes people nicer. \"We found that playing with a helpful partner increases the expectation of others to reciprocate that pro-social behavior,\" said author John Velez. He added that teaming up even makes you \"nicer to the other team... that just tried to beat you.\"</p>\n<p>Playing cooperatively, rather than alone -- even online -- can stimulate gamers' empathy so much that it negates the aggressive effects of violent games and even carries over into the real world. Velez found that players were more likely to help out pals in social situations and less likely to be <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2015/01/21/crash-ooverride-anti-gamergate/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\">hostile</a> to friend and foe alike. \"What we found was cooperative play seems to have the biggest effect in terms of decreasing aggression toward other people,\" he said.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>What we found was cooperative play seems to have the biggest effect in terms of decreasing aggression toward other people.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>On the downside, because of the way that gaming stimulates your brain, it may increase your risk to neurological disorders like Alzheimer&#39;s Disease. Researchers from the Douglas Institute and Université de Montréal <a href=\"http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2015-05/dmhu-ssn051915.php\">found</a> that gamers tend to navigate their environment using the brain's reward center (the caudate nucleas), rather than using spatial memory from the hippocampus like non-gamers. The results were hardly conclusive, and the team said that further studies should focus on specific games. But the study shows that while gaming may make you more <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2010/12/20/132077565/video-games-boost-brain-power-multitasking-skills\">attentive visually</a>, that might be outweighed by the negative effects on your brain.</p>\n<p>Filed under: <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/category/gaming/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\" rel=\"tag\">Gaming</a></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2015/05/20/gaming-cooperatively-makes-you-more-sociable/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget#comments\">Comments</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Via:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/05/150508105656.htm\">Science Daily</a></p>\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href=\"http://today.ttu.edu/posts/2015/05/cooperative-video-game-play-elicits-pro-social-behavior\">Texas Tech University</a>, <a href=\"http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2015-05/dmhu-ssn051915.php\">EurekAlert</a></p>",

Yes and no, if you ask <em>NPR</em>. The outlet <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/sections/money/2015/05/20/406484294/an-npr-reporter-raced-a-machine-to-write-a-news-story-who-won\">held a showdown</a> between Automated Insights' WordSmith news generator and a seasoned reporter to see which of the two could not only finish an earnings story the quickest, but produce something you'd <em>want</em> to read. The results? WordSmith was much faster, producing its piece in two minutes versus seven, but the writing was more than a little stiff -- it lacked the colorful expressions that made <em>NPR</em>&#39;s version easy to digest. With that said, newsies might not want to relax just yet. It&#39;s technically possible for software to adapt to a given style, so flesh-and-bone writers may still want to update their resumés... y&#39;know, just in case.</p>\n\n<p>[Image credit: Justin Cook, <em>NPR</em>]</p>\n<p align=\"center\"></p>\n<p>Filed under: <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/category/software/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\" rel=\"tag\">Software</a></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2015/05/20/robotic-news-writer-showdown/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget#comments\">Comments</a></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/sections/money/2015/05/20/406484294/an-npr-reporter-raced-a-machine-to-write-a-news-story-who-won\">NPR</a></p>",

The act disrupted more than 50 schools, bringing everything from payroll to standardized tests grinding to a halt. Unfortunate students undertaking the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idaho_Standards_Achievement_Test\">Idaho Standard Achievement test</a> were required to go through the process multiple times because the system kept losing their work and results.</span></p>\n<p><span>The report goes on to say that authorities have found the Eagle High student from their IP address, and could now face State and Federal felony charges. If found guilty, the unnamed individual is likely to serve up to 180 days in jail, as well as being expelled from school. In addition, the suspect's parents are going to be asked to pay for the financial losses suffered as a consequence of the attack. At the same time, a middle school student is also under investigation for attempting a similar attack shortly afterward. If there's one lesson that we should take away from all of this, it's that no matter what you do, you can never escape your exams. </span></p>\n\n<center></center>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2015/05/20/teenager-idaho-ddos/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget#comments\">Comments</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Via:</strong> <a href=\"http://kotaku.com/kid-arrested-for-doxxing-entire-school-district-1705666374\">Kotaku</a>, <a href=\"http://www.dailydot.com/crime/idaho-high-school-student-ddos-attack-felony/\">The Daily Dot</a></p>\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.ktvb.com/story/news/crime/2015/05/15/student-accused-of-cyber-attack-on-west-ada-district/27403905/\">KTVB</a></p>",

In the UK, that used to mean switching on CBBC or CITV, but in the internet age <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2014/10/02/netflix-animated-king-kong-series/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\">Netflix</a> and <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2015/02/19/youtube-for-kids/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\">YouTube</a> rule supreme. After all, it means you can find the exact show or movie that's likely to put a smile back on the little tikes' faces. That could spell trouble for Sky, so the broadcaster is <a href=\"https://corporate.sky.com/media-centre/news-page/2015/the-abc-of-kids-tv--sky-adding-thousands-of-episodes-of-kids-tv-to-on-demand-service\">revamping its child-centric on-demand offerings</a>. A software update rolling out to all Sky+HD boxes this week will put a new \"Kids\" tile on the homepage, providing instant access to on-demand shows and movies, kids TV recordings and live channels such as Cbeebies and Nick Jr. In addition, Sky is expanding its library of on-demand episodes from 700 to 4,000 over the coming months. It'll include new morsels of <em>SpongeBob Squarepants</em>, <em>Dora the Explorer</em> and <em>Ben 10</em>, as well as cult favourite <em>Adventure Time</em>. YouTube appeals because it's (mostly) free, but if you've been stressed out before trying to find a decent clip online, you might want to try grabbing your Sky remote next time.</p>\n\n<p>Filed under: <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/category/home-entertainment/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\" rel=\"tag\">Home Entertainment</a></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2015/05/21/sky-kids-netflix/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget#comments\">Comments</a></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href=\"https://corporate.sky.com/media-centre/news-page/2015/the-abc-of-kids-tv--sky-adding-thousands-of-episodes-of-kids-tv-to-on-demand-service\">Sky</a></p>",

Together with Google, it launched Code as a Second Language (CSL) courses in eight cities, including New York, Las Angeles and Miami. The idea is to introduce students to coding through 1-2 hour sessions, then steer them to the <a href=\"http://www.loftcsl.org/\">LOFT</a> (Latinos on Fast Track) network for ongoing online instruction. Students who complete that training could later be granted internships and possibly full-time positions with Fortune 500 companies.</p>\n<p>Volunteers or teachers learn to train kids on basic coding through a program called CS First. Google and the HHF plan to implement the CSL program in 30 additional LA schools later on, and launch pilot CSL programs at the Mexican consulates in San Jose and Washington, DC. Meanwhile, schools interested in the program can sign up <a href=\"http://www.loftcsl.org/school_signup\">here</a>, and volunteers instructors can enlist at <a href=\"http://www.loftcsl.org/volunteer_signup\">this link</a>.

What they did was insert strain gauges within the the Rift's foam padding to monitor the movements of the upper part of your face. To monitor the lower part not covered by the headset, they attached a 3D camera to a short boom clipped to the center of the Rift. As you can see in the video below the fold, a virtual avatar successfully mimicked the expressions of their testers with that setup.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center\"><iframe allowFullScreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"384\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/rgKkEnaaSDc?rel=0&amp;wmode=opaque\" width=\"630\"></iframe></div>\n\n<p>Project lead Hao Li believes the technology could make it more compelling to interact with others in virtual words; talking face to face, even as avatars, feels a lot more personal than text chats, after all.

Researchers at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory have <a href=\"https://www.llnl.gov/news/american-energy-use-slightly-carbon-emissions-almost-unchanged-0\">determined</a> that Americans' energy use climbed 1 percent year-over-year in 2014, but its carbon emissions hardly budged at all. In fact, they were down significantly for coal and petroleum-based power. While some of that decline is due to industry using less-than-clean natural gas, it's also helped by big jumps in <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2015/05/09/current-solar-power-tech-is-good-enough/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\">solar</a> and <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2015/01/16/new-york-city-wind-turbine/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\">wind</a> energy, which respectively grew by 33 and 8 percent.</p>\n<p>These eco-friendly sources still represent just a tiny piece of the puzzle at 2.2 percent of the US' entire demand, so there's no doubt that dirty power still dominates. Scientists are quick to add that green tech is running into roadblocks, as well -- wind turbine deployments have slowed down in the past two years, and California's drought shrank the use of hydroelectric power. All the same, it's evident that environmentally conscious electricity is significant enough to mitigate the US' damage to the planet.</p>\n\n<p>[Image credit: AP Photo/John Raoux]</p>\n<p>Filed under: <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/category/science/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\" rel=\"tag\">Science</a></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2015/05/21/us-study-shows-green-power-effect/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget#comments\">Comments</a></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.llnl.gov/news/american-energy-use-slightly-carbon-emissions-almost-unchanged-0\">Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory</a></p>",

The technology, known as an Implanted MyoElectric Sensor (IMES) will allow users to move the company's motorized Proprio Foot just like they do <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2015/04/01/thinking-cap-controls-prosthetic-arm-with-thoughts-not-surger/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\">the real thing</a>.</p>\n<p>With an existing analog (or even powered) prosthesis, there&#39;s often an infuriating lag between intention and action because the user has to physically contract a muscle to activate it. Not so with the IMES system. When electrical signals from the user&#39;s brain hit the end of the amputated leg, they&#39;re picked up by a pair of sensors embedded in the surrounding muscle tissue. These sensors, in turn, send a wireless signal to the Proprio foot telling it to flex or extend. And since the muscles themselves aren&#39;t contracting, there&#39;s no lag between thinking about moving and actually doing so. What&#39;s more, the implantation surgery only takes about 15 minutes and requires an single single-centimeter-long incision. Even cooler is the fact that the sensors are powered by tiny magnetic coils housed in the prosthetic socket so they won&#39;t have to be replaced once installed. &quot;We believe this is a lifelong sensor,&quot; Thorvaldur Ingvarsson, Ossur&#39;s head of R&amp;D, told <a href=\"http://www.popsci.com/brain-controlled-bionic-legs-are-here-no-really\"><em>Popular Science</em></a>.</p>\n\n<p>\"It's really surreal,\" Gudmundur Olafsson, one of the the company's two initial test subjects, said in a statement. \"The first time, to be honest, I started to cry. You are moving the ankle, and I basically haven't had one in 11 years.\" Olafsson spent 14 months using the IMES-enabled Proprio as his sole prosthetic.</p>\n\n<p>Up next, the company plans to hold large-scale clinical trials and hopes to have the device to market within the next three to five years. There's no word yet on how much the devices will cost once they do become available.</p>\n<p>Filed under: <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/category/wearables/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\" rel=\"tag\">Wearables</a>, <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/category/wireless/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\" rel=\"tag\">Wireless</a>, <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/category/science/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\" rel=\"tag\">Science</a></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2015/05/20/prosthetic-foot-mind-control/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget#comments\">Comments</a></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.popsci.com/brain-controlled-bionic-legs-are-here-no-really\">Popular Science</a></p>",

Yahoo and Georgia Tech researchers have <a href=\"http://yahoolabs.tumblr.com/post/119448741621/how-photo-filters-affect-online-engagement?soc_src=mail&amp;soc_trk=ma\">learned</a> that filtered photos (at least, on <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2015/05/07/flickr-builds-powerful-photo-search-engine-in-major-redesign/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\">Flickr</a>) are 21 percent more likely to get views, and 45 percent more likely to receive comments.  This doesn't mean that you can throw on any effect you like, mind you.  Warmer-looking filters usually get the best results, while colder examples have less of an impact.  In short, feel free to tweak your Instagram shots if you feel they lack a certain oomph that will draw in the crowds -- just don't try to be overly dark and edgy.</p>\n\n<p>Filed under: <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/category/cellphones/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\" rel=\"tag\">Cellphones</a>, <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/category/cameras/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\" rel=\"tag\">Cameras</a>, <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/category/internet/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\" rel=\"tag\">Internet</a>, <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/category/mobile/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\" rel=\"tag\">Mobile</a></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2015/05/20/photo-filter-study/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget#comments\">Comments</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Via:</strong> <a href=\"http://petapixel.com/2015/05/20/filtered-photos-are-21-more-likely-to-be-viewed/\">PetaPixel</a></p>\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href=\"http://yahoolabs.tumblr.com/post/119448741621/how-photo-filters-affect-online-engagement?soc_src=mail&amp;soc_trk=ma\">Yahoo Labs (Tumblr)</a></p>",

These are the first products Google has released under its new Editions project, a series of collaborations with artists to develop limited edition \"live cases\" for select Android phones. For this batch, Mountain View worked with electronic dance music producer/DJ <a href=\"http://www.joystiq.com/2014/03/15/skrillex-advergame-takes-dubstep-to-the-stars/\">Skrillex</a>, who designed an outer space-inspired set. Now, here's the cool part: in keeping with the space theme, the products come with live wallpapers showing images of the Earth from the stratosphere during the day and constellations visible from your location at night. The tech giant actually launched a high-altitude balloon named after Skrillex's dog Nanou to capture images of our planet and didn't just take images from NASA.\n\n<p></p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center\"><iframe allowFullScreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"384\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/4x8_95bXTTE?rel=0&amp;wmode=opaque\" width=\"630\"></iframe></div>\n\n<p>In addition, the cases are built with a shortcut button -- it leads to the DJ's YouTube feed out of the box, but you can reprogram it to launch the camera or any other specific app. The Skrillex Editions cases are now up for sale on <a href=\"https://store.google.com/magazine/skrillex_live_case_magazine?utm_source=Google&amp;utm_medium=Blog&amp;utm_content=Android&amp;utm_campaign=LaunchDay\">Google Store</a> for the <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/lg/nexus/5/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\">Nexus 5</a>, <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/motorola/nexus/6/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\">Nexus 6</a>, <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/samsung/galaxy/s5/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\">Samsung Galaxy S5</a>, <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/samsung/galaxy/s6/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\">Samsung Galaxy S6</a> and <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/samsung/galaxy/note/4/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\">Samsung Galaxy Note 4</a>.

Two new studies may further confuse you about the benefits, with one concluding that gaming makes you friendlier in the real world, and another implying it could <em>ruin your brain</em>. First the plus side: <a href=\"http://today.ttu.edu/posts/2015/05/cooperative-video-game-play-elicits-pro-social-behavior\">Texas Tech</a> researchers think that cooperative gameplay, whether in violent or non-violent games, makes people nicer. \"We found that playing with a helpful partner increases the expectation of others to reciprocate that pro-social behavior,\" said author John Velez. He added that teaming up even makes you \"nicer to the other team... that just tried to beat you.\"</p>\n<p>Playing cooperatively, rather than alone -- even online -- can stimulate gamers' empathy so much that it negates the aggressive effects of violent games and even carries over into the real world. Velez found that players were more likely to help out pals in social situations and less likely to be <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2015/01/21/crash-ooverride-anti-gamergate/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\">hostile</a> to friend and foe alike. \"What we found was cooperative play seems to have the biggest effect in terms of decreasing aggression toward other people,\" he said.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>What we found was cooperative play seems to have the biggest effect in terms of decreasing aggression toward other people.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>On the downside, because of the way that gaming stimulates your brain, it may increase your risk to neurological disorders like Alzheimer&#39;s Disease. Researchers from the Douglas Institute and Université de Montréal <a href=\"http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2015-05/dmhu-ssn051915.php\">found</a> that gamers tend to navigate their environment using the brain's reward center (the caudate nucleas), rather than using spatial memory from the hippocampus like non-gamers. The results were hardly conclusive, and the team said that further studies should focus on specific games. But the study shows that while gaming may make you more <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2010/12/20/132077565/video-games-boost-brain-power-multitasking-skills\">attentive visually</a>, that might be outweighed by the negative effects on your brain.</p>\n<p>Filed under: <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/category/gaming/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\" rel=\"tag\">Gaming</a></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2015/05/20/gaming-cooperatively-makes-you-more-sociable/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget#comments\">Comments</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Via:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/05/150508105656.htm\">Science Daily</a></p>\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href=\"http://today.ttu.edu/posts/2015/05/cooperative-video-game-play-elicits-pro-social-behavior\">Texas Tech University</a>, <a href=\"http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2015-05/dmhu-ssn051915.php\">EurekAlert</a></p>",

Yes and no, if you ask <em>NPR</em>. The outlet <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/sections/money/2015/05/20/406484294/an-npr-reporter-raced-a-machine-to-write-a-news-story-who-won\">held a showdown</a> between Automated Insights' WordSmith news generator and a seasoned reporter to see which of the two could not only finish an earnings story the quickest, but produce something you'd <em>want</em> to read. The results? WordSmith was much faster, producing its piece in two minutes versus seven, but the writing was more than a little stiff -- it lacked the colorful expressions that made <em>NPR</em>&#39;s version easy to digest. With that said, newsies might not want to relax just yet. It&#39;s technically possible for software to adapt to a given style, so flesh-and-bone writers may still want to update their resumés... y&#39;know, just in case.</p>\n\n<p>[Image credit: Justin Cook, <em>NPR</em>]</p>\n<p align=\"center\"></p>\n<p>Filed under: <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/category/software/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\" rel=\"tag\">Software</a></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2015/05/20/robotic-news-writer-showdown/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget#comments\">Comments</a></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/sections/money/2015/05/20/406484294/an-npr-reporter-raced-a-machine-to-write-a-news-story-who-won\">NPR</a></p>",

The act disrupted more than 50 schools, bringing everything from payroll to standardized tests grinding to a halt.

If found guilty, the unnamed individual is likely to serve up to 180 days in jail, as well as being expelled from school. In addition, the suspect's parents are going to be asked to pay for the financial losses suffered as a consequence of the attack. At the same time, a middle school student is also under investigation for attempting a similar attack shortly afterward.

Gamers especially flocked to the frame rate as it allowed for jutter-free playback of fast-paced titles like <em><a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2015/04/09/call-of-duty-black-ops-3-teaser/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\">Call of Duty</a></em> or<em> <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2015/03/13/titanfall-sequel-headed-to-more-than-just-xbox-and-windows/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\">Titanfall</a></em>.

The new frame rate is still an early preview, mind you, and will only be available on HTML5-compatible browsers. However, YouTube will encode these streams in both 720p60 and 1080p60 formats as well as automatically knock it down to 30FPS for devices that can't handle full speed.</p>\n\n<div></div>\nWhat's more, YouTube is also rolling out HTML5 playback which will enable viewers to not only rewind in the middle of a live stream but also play it back at up to double speed in order to catch back up to the broadcast. And for producers, the video-sharing site has collaborated with Elgato and XSplit to ensure that products like <a href=\"https://www.elgato.com/gaming/download\">Elgato Game Capture</a>, <a href=\"https://www.xsplit.com/blog/xsplit-broadcaster-and-xsplit-gamecaster-v2-3-are-now-available\">XSplit Broadcaster</a> and <a href=\"https://www.xsplit.com/blog/xsplit-broadcaster-and-xsplit-gamecaster-v2-3-are-now-available\">XSplit Gamecaster</a> will continue to work with the site.\n<p>Filed under: <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/category/displays/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\" rel=\"tag\">Displays</a>, <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/category/google/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\" rel=\"tag\">Google</a></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2015/05/21/youtube-now-supports-60-fps-live-streaming/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget#comments\">Comments</a></strong></p>",

It'll include new morsels of <em>SpongeBob Squarepants</em>, <em>Dora the Explorer</em> and <em>Ben 10</em>, as well as cult favourite <em>Adventure Time</em>.

Together with Google, it launched Code as a Second Language (CSL) courses in eight cities, including New York, Las Angeles and Miami. The idea is to introduce students to coding through 1-2 hour sessions, then steer them to the <a href=\"http://www.loftcsl.org/\">LOFT</a> (Latinos on Fast Track) network for ongoing online instruction. Students who complete that training could later be granted internships and possibly full-time positions with Fortune 500 companies.</p>\n<p>Volunteers or teachers learn to train kids on basic coding through a program called CS First. Google and the HHF plan to implement the CSL program in 30 additional LA schools later on, and launch pilot CSL programs at the Mexican consulates in San Jose and Washington, DC. Meanwhile, schools interested in the program can sign up <a href=\"http://www.loftcsl.org/school_signup\">here</a>, and volunteers instructors can enlist at <a href=\"http://www.loftcsl.org/volunteer_signup\">this link</a>.

From today, customers in Manhattan, <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2014/12/18/amazon-prime-now/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\">the company's first Prime Now location</a>, can shop at a number of local businesses and have fresh food delivered within 60 minutes. D'Agostino, Gourmet Garage and Billy's Bakery are the first companies on board, offering groceries, cooked meals and freshly baked cupcakes respectively alongside Amazon's own range of goods. The online retailer is starting small but plans to add more stores across Manhattan over time, with Italian food market Eataly and Westside Market already waiting in the wings. As before, Prime Now's one-hour deliveries cost $7.99, so be sure to factor that in before impulse buying those delicious treats.</p>\n\n<p>Filed under: <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/category/household/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\" rel=\"tag\">Household</a>, <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/category/internet/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\" rel=\"tag\">Internet</a>, <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/category/mobile/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\" rel=\"tag\">Mobile</a>, <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/category/amazon/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\" rel=\"tag\">Amazon</a></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2015/05/21/amazons-one-hour-delivery-service-now-features-local-stores/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget#comments\">Comments</a></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20150521005405/en/Prime-One-Hour-Delivery-Favorite-Local-Stores#.VV2FPBPF9Cc\">Amazon (Businesswire)</a></p>",

Well apparently, that kind of face-tracking tech already exists. Facebook's <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2015/05/19/oculus-mobile-jam-vr-finalists/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\">Oculus division</a> has teamed up with University of Southern California researchers to develop a way to track your facial expressions while wearing a <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2015/05/06/early-2016-oculus-rift-consumer/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\">chunky VR headset</a>. What they did was insert strain gauges within the the Rift's foam padding to monitor the movements of the upper part of your face. To monitor the lower part not covered by the headset, they attached a 3D camera to a short boom clipped to the center of the Rift. As you can see in the video below the fold, a virtual avatar successfully mimicked the expressions of their testers with that setup.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center\"><iframe allowFullScreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"384\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/rgKkEnaaSDc?rel=0&amp;wmode=opaque\" width=\"630\"></iframe></div>\n\n<p>Project lead Hao Li believes the technology could make it more compelling to interact with others in virtual words; talking face to face, even as avatars, feels a lot more personal than text chats, after all.

Researchers at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory have <a href=\"https://www.llnl.gov/news/american-energy-use-slightly-carbon-emissions-almost-unchanged-0\">determined</a> that Americans' energy use climbed 1 percent year-over-year in 2014, but its carbon emissions hardly budged at all. In fact, they were down significantly for coal and petroleum-based power. While some of that decline is due to industry using less-than-clean natural gas, it's also helped by big jumps in <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2015/05/09/current-solar-power-tech-is-good-enough/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\">solar</a> and <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2015/01/16/new-york-city-wind-turbine/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\">wind</a> energy, which respectively grew by 33 and 8 percent.</p>\n<p>These eco-friendly sources still represent just a tiny piece of the puzzle at 2.2 percent of the US' entire demand, so there's no doubt that dirty power still dominates. Scientists are quick to add that green tech is running into roadblocks, as well -- wind turbine deployments have slowed down in the past two years, and California's drought shrank the use of hydroelectric power. All the same, it's evident that environmentally conscious electricity is significant enough to mitigate the US' damage to the planet.</p>\n\n<p>[Image credit: AP Photo/John Raoux]</p>\n<p>Filed under: <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/category/science/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\" rel=\"tag\">Science</a></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2015/05/21/us-study-shows-green-power-effect/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget#comments\">Comments</a></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.llnl.gov/news/american-energy-use-slightly-carbon-emissions-almost-unchanged-0\">Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory</a></p>",

Even so, it's good to see that future connected drones will be built from the start with network security in mind.</p>\n\n<p>[Image credit: AP Photo/Steve Helber]</p>\n<p>Filed under: <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/category/robots/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\" rel=\"tag\">Robots</a></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2015/05/20/us-navy-wants-hack-resistant-drones/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget#comments\">Comments</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Via:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.nextgov.com/cybersecurity/2015/05/who-knows-if-navy-drones-and-airborne-weapons-are-hackable/113134/?oref=ng-HPtopstory\">Nextgov</a>, <a href=\"http://www.defenseone.com/technology/2015/05/navy-trying-hack-proof-its-drones/113311/\">Defense One</a></p>\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;id=6dd007eb4561583a583d66658e8f3c16&amp;tab=core&amp;_cview=0\">FedBizOpps.gov</a></p>",

And while Lycos hasn't made many headlines lately, the company still maintains an impressive portfolio of technology patents. Its patents are wide-ranging enough that Google already got into trouble over old Lycos tech <a href=\"http://hamptonroads.com/2012/11/norfolk-jury-awards-30-million-small-tech-company\">back in 2012</a> before winning its case on an appeal <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-08-15/vringo-loses-appeals-court-ruling-in-google-patent-case-1-\">last year</a>.

The technology, known as an Implanted MyoElectric Sensor (IMES) will allow users to move the company's motorized Proprio Foot just like they do <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2015/04/01/thinking-cap-controls-prosthetic-arm-with-thoughts-not-surger/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\">the real thing</a>.</p>\n<p>With an existing analog (or even powered) prosthesis, there&#39;s often an infuriating lag between intention and action because the user has to physically contract a muscle to activate it. Not so with the IMES system. When electrical signals from the user&#39;s brain hit the end of the amputated leg, they&#39;re picked up by a pair of sensors embedded in the surrounding muscle tissue. These sensors, in turn, send a wireless signal to the Proprio foot telling it to flex or extend. And since the muscles themselves aren&#39;t contracting, there&#39;s no lag between thinking about moving and actually doing so. What&#39;s more, the implantation surgery only takes about 15 minutes and requires an single single-centimeter-long incision. Even cooler is the fact that the sensors are powered by tiny magnetic coils housed in the prosthetic socket so they won&#39;t have to be replaced once installed. &quot;We believe this is a lifelong sensor,&quot; Thorvaldur Ingvarsson, Ossur&#39;s head of R&amp;D, told <a href=\"http://www.popsci.com/brain-controlled-bionic-legs-are-here-no-really\"><em>Popular Science</em></a>.</p>\n\n<p>\"It's really surreal,\" Gudmundur Olafsson, one of the the company's two initial test subjects, said in a statement. \"The first time, to be honest, I started to cry. You are moving the ankle, and I basically haven't had one in 11 years.\" Olafsson spent 14 months using the IMES-enabled Proprio as his sole prosthetic.</p>\n\n<p>Up next, the company plans to hold large-scale clinical trials and hopes to have the device to market within the next three to five years. There's no word yet on how much the devices will cost once they do become available.</p>\n<p>Filed under: <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/category/wearables/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\" rel=\"tag\">Wearables</a>, <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/category/wireless/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\" rel=\"tag\">Wireless</a>, <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/category/science/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\" rel=\"tag\">Science</a></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2015/05/20/prosthetic-foot-mind-control/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget#comments\">Comments</a></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.popsci.com/brain-controlled-bionic-legs-are-here-no-really\">Popular Science</a></p>",

This doesn't mean that you can throw on any effect you like, mind you.  Warmer-looking filters usually get the best results, while colder examples have less of an impact.

These are the first products Google has released under its new Editions project, a series of collaborations with artists to develop limited edition \"live cases\" for select Android phones. For this batch, Mountain View worked with electronic dance music producer/DJ <a href=\"http://www.joystiq.com/2014/03/15/skrillex-advergame-takes-dubstep-to-the-stars/\">Skrillex</a>, who designed an outer space-inspired set. Now, here's the cool part: in keeping with the space theme, the products come with live wallpapers showing images of the Earth from the stratosphere during the day and constellations visible from your location at night. The tech giant actually launched a high-altitude balloon named after Skrillex's dog Nanou to capture images of our planet and didn't just take images from NASA.\n\n<p></p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center\"><iframe allowFullScreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"384\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/4x8_95bXTTE?rel=0&amp;wmode=opaque\" width=\"630\"></iframe></div>\n\n<p>In addition, the cases are built with a shortcut button -- it leads to the DJ's YouTube feed out of the box, but you can reprogram it to launch the camera or any other specific app. The Skrillex Editions cases are now up for sale on <a href=\"https://store.google.com/magazine/skrillex_live_case_magazine?utm_source=Google&amp;utm_medium=Blog&amp;utm_content=Android&amp;utm_campaign=LaunchDay\">Google Store</a> for the <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/lg/nexus/5/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\">Nexus 5</a>, <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/motorola/nexus/6/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\">Nexus 6</a>, <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/samsung/galaxy/s5/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\">Samsung Galaxy S5</a>, <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/samsung/galaxy/s6/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\">Samsung Galaxy S6</a> and <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/samsung/galaxy/note/4/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\">Samsung Galaxy Note 4</a>.

Two new studies may further confuse you about the benefits, with one concluding that gaming makes you friendlier in the real world, and another implying it could <em>ruin your brain</em>. First the plus side: <a href=\"http://today.ttu.edu/posts/2015/05/cooperative-video-game-play-elicits-pro-social-behavior\">Texas Tech</a> researchers think that cooperative gameplay, whether in violent or non-violent games, makes people nicer. \"We found that playing with a helpful partner increases the expectation of others to reciprocate that pro-social behavior,\" said author John Velez. He added that teaming up even makes you \"nicer to the other team... that just tried to beat you.\"</p>\n<p>Playing cooperatively, rather than alone -- even online -- can stimulate gamers' empathy so much that it negates the aggressive effects of violent games and even carries over into the real world. Velez found that players were more likely to help out pals in social situations and less likely to be <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2015/01/21/crash-ooverride-anti-gamergate/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\">hostile</a> to friend and foe alike. \"What we found was cooperative play seems to have the biggest effect in terms of decreasing aggression toward other people,\" he said.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>What we found was cooperative play seems to have the biggest effect in terms of decreasing aggression toward other people.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>On the downside, because of the way that gaming stimulates your brain, it may increase your risk to neurological disorders like Alzheimer&#39;s Disease. Researchers from the Douglas Institute and Université de Montréal <a href=\"http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2015-05/dmhu-ssn051915.php\">found</a> that gamers tend to navigate their environment using the brain's reward center (the caudate nucleas), rather than using spatial memory from the hippocampus like non-gamers. The results were hardly conclusive, and the team said that further studies should focus on specific games. But the study shows that while gaming may make you more <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2010/12/20/132077565/video-games-boost-brain-power-multitasking-skills\">attentive visually</a>, that might be outweighed by the negative effects on your brain.</p>\n<p>Filed under: <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/category/gaming/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\" rel=\"tag\">Gaming</a></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2015/05/20/gaming-cooperatively-makes-you-more-sociable/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget#comments\">Comments</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Via:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/05/150508105656.htm\">Science Daily</a></p>\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href=\"http://today.ttu.edu/posts/2015/05/cooperative-video-game-play-elicits-pro-social-behavior\">Texas Tech University</a>, <a href=\"http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2015-05/dmhu-ssn051915.php\">EurekAlert</a></p>",

The results? WordSmith was much faster, producing its piece in two minutes versus seven, but the writing was more than a little stiff -- it lacked the colorful expressions that made <em>NPR</em>&#39;s version easy to digest. With that said, newsies might not want to relax just yet.

The act disrupted more than 50 schools, bringing everything from payroll to standardized tests grinding to a halt.

If found guilty, the unnamed individual is likely to serve up to 180 days in jail, as well as being expelled from school. In addition, the suspect's parents are going to be asked to pay for the financial losses suffered as a consequence of the attack. At the same time, a middle school student is also under investigation for attempting a similar attack shortly afterward.

It'll include new morsels of <em>SpongeBob Squarepants</em>, <em>Dora the Explorer</em> and <em>Ben 10</em>, as well as cult favourite <em>Adventure Time</em>.

Together with Google, it launched Code as a Second Language (CSL) courses in eight cities, including New York, Las Angeles and Miami. The idea is to introduce students to coding through 1-2 hour sessions, then steer them to the <a href=\"http://www.loftcsl.org/\">LOFT</a> (Latinos on Fast Track) network for ongoing online instruction. Students who complete that training could later be granted internships and possibly full-time positions with Fortune 500 companies.</p>\n<p>Volunteers or teachers learn to train kids on basic coding through a program called CS First. Google and the HHF plan to implement the CSL program in 30 additional LA schools later on, and launch pilot CSL programs at the Mexican consulates in San Jose and Washington, DC. Meanwhile, schools interested in the program can sign up <a href=\"http://www.loftcsl.org/school_signup\">here</a>, and volunteers instructors can enlist at <a href=\"http://www.loftcsl.org/volunteer_signup\">this link</a>. Google also runs the <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2014/06/19/google-aims-to-inspire-girls-to-code-with-new-initiative/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\">Made with Code</a> program for girls and obviously has some self-interest in developing programmers (as does Apple, which just launched its <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2015/03/10/apple-diversity-efforts/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\">own initiative</a>). But given that only 1 in 10 US schools teach coding, along with the lack of women and minorities in tech, the efforts are certainly welcome.</p>\n\n<p>[Image credit: Televisa Foundation]</p>\n<p>Filed under: <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/category/internet/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\" rel=\"tag\">Internet</a>, <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/category/software/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\" rel=\"tag\">Software</a>, <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/category/google/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\" rel=\"tag\">Google</a></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2015/05/21/google-code-as-a-second-language/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget#comments\">Comments</a></strong></p>",

What they did was insert strain gauges within the the Rift's foam padding to monitor the movements of the upper part of your face. To monitor the lower part not covered by the headset, they attached a 3D camera to a short boom clipped to the center of the Rift. As you can see in the video below the fold, a virtual avatar successfully mimicked the expressions of their testers with that setup.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center\"><iframe allowFullScreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"384\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/rgKkEnaaSDc?rel=0&amp;wmode=opaque\" width=\"630\"></iframe></div>\n\n<p>Project lead Hao Li believes the technology could make it more compelling to interact with others in virtual words; talking face to face, even as avatars, feels a lot more personal than text chats, after all.

Researchers at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory have <a href=\"https://www.llnl.gov/news/american-energy-use-slightly-carbon-emissions-almost-unchanged-0\">determined</a> that Americans' energy use climbed 1 percent year-over-year in 2014, but its carbon emissions hardly budged at all. In fact, they were down significantly for coal and petroleum-based power. While some of that decline is due to industry using less-than-clean natural gas, it's also helped by big jumps in <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2015/05/09/current-solar-power-tech-is-good-enough/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\">solar</a> and <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2015/01/16/new-york-city-wind-turbine/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\">wind</a> energy, which respectively grew by 33 and 8 percent.</p>\n<p>These eco-friendly sources still represent just a tiny piece of the puzzle at 2.2 percent of the US' entire demand, so there's no doubt that dirty power still dominates. Scientists are quick to add that green tech is running into roadblocks, as well -- wind turbine deployments have slowed down in the past two years, and California's drought shrank the use of hydroelectric power. All the same, it's evident that environmentally conscious electricity is significant enough to mitigate the US' damage to the planet.</p>\n\n<p>[Image credit: AP Photo/John Raoux]</p>\n<p>Filed under: <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/category/science/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\" rel=\"tag\">Science</a></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2015/05/21/us-study-shows-green-power-effect/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget#comments\">Comments</a></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.llnl.gov/news/american-energy-use-slightly-carbon-emissions-almost-unchanged-0\">Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory</a></p>",

Whoever has the best proposal will (hopefully) craft systems that not only prevent enemies from getting in, but bounce back quickly if the worst happens.</p>\n<p>As you might suspect, this effort faces a few challenges.  Besides the inherent optimism behind creating hack-resistant tech -- the odds are that <em>someone</em> will find a way in -- the Navy won't even start reviewing proposals until May 2016.  That likely leaves at least a few years before these more resilient robotic warriors are flying over hostile waters.  Even so, it's good to see that future connected drones will be built from the start with network security in mind.</p>\n\n<p>[Image credit: AP Photo/Steve Helber]</p>\n<p>Filed under: <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/category/robots/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\" rel=\"tag\">Robots</a></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2015/05/20/us-navy-wants-hack-resistant-drones/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget#comments\">Comments</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Via:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.nextgov.com/cybersecurity/2015/05/who-knows-if-navy-drones-and-airborne-weapons-are-hackable/113134/?oref=ng-HPtopstory\">Nextgov</a>, <a href=\"http://www.defenseone.com/technology/2015/05/navy-trying-hack-proof-its-drones/113311/\">Defense One</a></p>\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;id=6dd007eb4561583a583d66658e8f3c16&amp;tab=core&amp;_cview=0\">FedBizOpps.gov</a></p>",

The technology, known as an Implanted MyoElectric Sensor (IMES) will allow users to move the company's motorized Proprio Foot just like they do <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2015/04/01/thinking-cap-controls-prosthetic-arm-with-thoughts-not-surger/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\">the real thing</a>.</p>\n<p>With an existing analog (or even powered) prosthesis, there&#39;s often an infuriating lag between intention and action because the user has to physically contract a muscle to activate it. Not so with the IMES system. When electrical signals from the user&#39;s brain hit the end of the amputated leg, they&#39;re picked up by a pair of sensors embedded in the surrounding muscle tissue. These sensors, in turn, send a wireless signal to the Proprio foot telling it to flex or extend. And since the muscles themselves aren&#39;t contracting, there&#39;s no lag between thinking about moving and actually doing so. What&#39;s more, the implantation surgery only takes about 15 minutes and requires an single single-centimeter-long incision. Even cooler is the fact that the sensors are powered by tiny magnetic coils housed in the prosthetic socket so they won&#39;t have to be replaced once installed. &quot;We believe this is a lifelong sensor,&quot; Thorvaldur Ingvarsson, Ossur&#39;s head of R&amp;D, told <a href=\"http://www.popsci.com/brain-controlled-bionic-legs-are-here-no-really\"><em>Popular Science</em></a>.</p>\n\n<p>\"It's really surreal,\" Gudmundur Olafsson, one of the the company's two initial test subjects, said in a statement. \"The first time, to be honest, I started to cry. You are moving the ankle, and I basically haven't had one in 11 years.\" Olafsson spent 14 months using the IMES-enabled Proprio as his sole prosthetic.</p>\n\n<p>Up next, the company plans to hold large-scale clinical trials and hopes to have the device to market within the next three to five years. There's no word yet on how much the devices will cost once they do become available.</p>\n<p>Filed under: <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/category/wearables/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\" rel=\"tag\">Wearables</a>, <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/category/wireless/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\" rel=\"tag\">Wireless</a>, <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/category/science/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\" rel=\"tag\">Science</a></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2015/05/20/prosthetic-foot-mind-control/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget#comments\">Comments</a></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.popsci.com/brain-controlled-bionic-legs-are-here-no-really\">Popular Science</a></p>",

Now, here's the cool part: in keeping with the space theme, the products come with live wallpapers showing images of the Earth from the stratosphere during the day and constellations visible from your location at night. The tech giant actually launched a high-altitude balloon named after Skrillex's dog Nanou to capture images of our planet and didn't just take images from NASA.\n\n<p></p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center\"><iframe allowFullScreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"384\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/4x8_95bXTTE?rel=0&amp;wmode=opaque\" width=\"630\"></iframe></div>\n\n<p>In addition, the cases are built with a shortcut button -- it leads to the DJ's YouTube feed out of the box, but you can reprogram it to launch the camera or any other specific app. The Skrillex Editions cases are now up for sale on <a href=\"https://store.google.com/magazine/skrillex_live_case_magazine?utm_source=Google&amp;utm_medium=Blog&amp;utm_content=Android&amp;utm_campaign=LaunchDay\">Google Store</a> for the <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/lg/nexus/5/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\">Nexus 5</a>, <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/motorola/nexus/6/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\">Nexus 6</a>, <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/samsung/galaxy/s5/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\">Samsung Galaxy S5</a>, <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/samsung/galaxy/s6/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\">Samsung Galaxy S6</a> and <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/samsung/galaxy/note/4/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\">Samsung Galaxy Note 4</a>.

Two new studies may further confuse you about the benefits, with one concluding that gaming makes you friendlier in the real world, and another implying it could <em>ruin your brain</em>. First the plus side: <a href=\"http://today.ttu.edu/posts/2015/05/cooperative-video-game-play-elicits-pro-social-behavior\">Texas Tech</a> researchers think that cooperative gameplay, whether in violent or non-violent games, makes people nicer. \"We found that playing with a helpful partner increases the expectation of others to reciprocate that pro-social behavior,\" said author John Velez. He added that teaming up even makes you \"nicer to the other team... that just tried to beat you.\"</p>\n<p>Playing cooperatively, rather than alone -- even online -- can stimulate gamers' empathy so much that it negates the aggressive effects of violent games and even carries over into the real world. Velez found that players were more likely to help out pals in social situations and less likely to be <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2015/01/21/crash-ooverride-anti-gamergate/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\">hostile</a> to friend and foe alike. \"What we found was cooperative play seems to have the biggest effect in terms of decreasing aggression toward other people,\" he said.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>What we found was cooperative play seems to have the biggest effect in terms of decreasing aggression toward other people.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>On the downside, because of the way that gaming stimulates your brain, it may increase your risk to neurological disorders like Alzheimer&#39;s Disease. Researchers from the Douglas Institute and Université de Montréal <a href=\"http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2015-05/dmhu-ssn051915.php\">found</a> that gamers tend to navigate their environment using the brain's reward center (the caudate nucleas), rather than using spatial memory from the hippocampus like non-gamers. The results were hardly conclusive, and the team said that further studies should focus on specific games. But the study shows that while gaming may make you more <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2010/12/20/132077565/video-games-boost-brain-power-multitasking-skills\">attentive visually</a>, that might be outweighed by the negative effects on your brain.</p>\n<p>Filed under: <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/category/gaming/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\" rel=\"tag\">Gaming</a></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2015/05/20/gaming-cooperatively-makes-you-more-sociable/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget#comments\">Comments</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Via:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/05/150508105656.htm\">Science Daily</a></p>\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href=\"http://today.ttu.edu/posts/2015/05/cooperative-video-game-play-elicits-pro-social-behavior\">Texas Tech University</a>, <a href=\"http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2015-05/dmhu-ssn051915.php\">EurekAlert</a></p>",

Yes and no, if you ask <em>NPR</em>. The outlet <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/sections/money/2015/05/20/406484294/an-npr-reporter-raced-a-machine-to-write-a-news-story-who-won\">held a showdown</a> between Automated Insights' WordSmith news generator and a seasoned reporter to see which of the two could not only finish an earnings story the quickest, but produce something you'd <em>want</em> to read. The results? WordSmith was much faster, producing its piece in two minutes versus seven, but the writing was more than a little stiff -- it lacked the colorful expressions that made <em>NPR</em>&#39;s version easy to digest. With that said, newsies might not want to relax just yet. It&#39;s technically possible for software to adapt to a given style, so flesh-and-bone writers may still want to update their resumés... y&#39;know, just in case.</p>\n\n<p>[Image credit: Justin Cook, <em>NPR</em>]</p>\n<p align=\"center\"></p>\n<p>Filed under: <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/category/software/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\" rel=\"tag\">Software</a></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2015/05/20/robotic-news-writer-showdown/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget#comments\">Comments</a></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/sections/money/2015/05/20/406484294/an-npr-reporter-raced-a-machine-to-write-a-news-story-who-won\">NPR</a></p>",

The act disrupted more than 50 schools, bringing everything from payroll to standardized tests grinding to a halt. Unfortunate students undertaking the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idaho_Standards_Achievement_Test\">Idaho Standard Achievement test</a> were required to go through the process multiple times because the system kept losing their work and results.</span></p>\n<p><span>The report goes on to say that authorities have found the Eagle High student from their IP address, and could now face State and Federal felony charges. If found guilty, the unnamed individual is likely to serve up to 180 days in jail, as well as being expelled from school. In addition, the suspect's parents are going to be asked to pay for the financial losses suffered as a consequence of the attack. At the same time, a middle school student is also under investigation for attempting a similar attack shortly afterward. If there's one lesson that we should take away from all of this, it's that no matter what you do, you can never escape your exams. </span></p>\n\n<center></center>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2015/05/20/teenager-idaho-ddos/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget#comments\">Comments</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Via:</strong> <a href=\"http://kotaku.com/kid-arrested-for-doxxing-entire-school-district-1705666374\">Kotaku</a>, <a href=\"http://www.dailydot.com/crime/idaho-high-school-student-ddos-attack-felony/\">The Daily Dot</a></p>\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.ktvb.com/story/news/crime/2015/05/15/student-accused-of-cyber-attack-on-west-ada-district/27403905/\">KTVB</a></p>",

In the UK, that used to mean switching on CBBC or CITV, but in the internet age <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2014/10/02/netflix-animated-king-kong-series/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\">Netflix</a> and <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2015/02/19/youtube-for-kids/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\">YouTube</a> rule supreme. After all, it means you can find the exact show or movie that's likely to put a smile back on the little tikes' faces. That could spell trouble for Sky, so the broadcaster is <a href=\"https://corporate.sky.com/media-centre/news-page/2015/the-abc-of-kids-tv--sky-adding-thousands-of-episodes-of-kids-tv-to-on-demand-service\">revamping its child-centric on-demand offerings</a>. A software update rolling out to all Sky+HD boxes this week will put a new \"Kids\" tile on the homepage, providing instant access to on-demand shows and movies, kids TV recordings and live channels such as Cbeebies and Nick Jr. In addition, Sky is expanding its library of on-demand episodes from 700 to 4,000 over the coming months. It'll include new morsels of <em>SpongeBob Squarepants</em>, <em>Dora the Explorer</em> and <em>Ben 10</em>, as well as cult favourite <em>Adventure Time</em>. YouTube appeals because it's (mostly) free, but if you've been stressed out before trying to find a decent clip online, you might want to try grabbing your Sky remote next time.</p>\n\n<p>Filed under: <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/category/home-entertainment/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\" rel=\"tag\">Home Entertainment</a></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2015/05/21/sky-kids-netflix/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget#comments\">Comments</a></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href=\"https://corporate.sky.com/media-centre/news-page/2015/the-abc-of-kids-tv--sky-adding-thousands-of-episodes-of-kids-tv-to-on-demand-service\">Sky</a></p>",

Together with Google, it launched Code as a Second Language (CSL) courses in eight cities, including New York, Las Angeles and Miami. The idea is to introduce students to coding through 1-2 hour sessions, then steer them to the <a href=\"http://www.loftcsl.org/\">LOFT</a> (Latinos on Fast Track) network for ongoing online instruction. Students who complete that training could later be granted internships and possibly full-time positions with Fortune 500 companies.</p>\n<p>Volunteers or teachers learn to train kids on basic coding through a program called CS First. Google and the HHF plan to implement the CSL program in 30 additional LA schools later on, and launch pilot CSL programs at the Mexican consulates in San Jose and Washington, DC. Meanwhile, schools interested in the program can sign up <a href=\"http://www.loftcsl.org/school_signup\">here</a>, and volunteers instructors can enlist at <a href=\"http://www.loftcsl.org/volunteer_signup\">this link</a>.

What they did was insert strain gauges within the the Rift's foam padding to monitor the movements of the upper part of your face. To monitor the lower part not covered by the headset, they attached a 3D camera to a short boom clipped to the center of the Rift. As you can see in the video below the fold, a virtual avatar successfully mimicked the expressions of their testers with that setup.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center\"><iframe allowFullScreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"384\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/rgKkEnaaSDc?rel=0&amp;wmode=opaque\" width=\"630\"></iframe></div>\n\n<p>Project lead Hao Li believes the technology could make it more compelling to interact with others in virtual words; talking face to face, even as avatars, feels a lot more personal than text chats, after all.

Researchers at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory have <a href=\"https://www.llnl.gov/news/american-energy-use-slightly-carbon-emissions-almost-unchanged-0\">determined</a> that Americans' energy use climbed 1 percent year-over-year in 2014, but its carbon emissions hardly budged at all. In fact, they were down significantly for coal and petroleum-based power. While some of that decline is due to industry using less-than-clean natural gas, it's also helped by big jumps in <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2015/05/09/current-solar-power-tech-is-good-enough/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\">solar</a> and <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2015/01/16/new-york-city-wind-turbine/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\">wind</a> energy, which respectively grew by 33 and 8 percent.</p>\n<p>These eco-friendly sources still represent just a tiny piece of the puzzle at 2.2 percent of the US' entire demand, so there's no doubt that dirty power still dominates. Scientists are quick to add that green tech is running into roadblocks, as well -- wind turbine deployments have slowed down in the past two years, and California's drought shrank the use of hydroelectric power. All the same, it's evident that environmentally conscious electricity is significant enough to mitigate the US' damage to the planet.</p>\n\n<p>[Image credit: AP Photo/John Raoux]</p>\n<p>Filed under: <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/category/science/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\" rel=\"tag\">Science</a></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2015/05/21/us-study-shows-green-power-effect/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget#comments\">Comments</a></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.llnl.gov/news/american-energy-use-slightly-carbon-emissions-almost-unchanged-0\">Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory</a></p>",

The technology, known as an Implanted MyoElectric Sensor (IMES) will allow users to move the company's motorized Proprio Foot just like they do <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2015/04/01/thinking-cap-controls-prosthetic-arm-with-thoughts-not-surger/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\">the real thing</a>.</p>\n<p>With an existing analog (or even powered) prosthesis, there&#39;s often an infuriating lag between intention and action because the user has to physically contract a muscle to activate it. Not so with the IMES system. When electrical signals from the user&#39;s brain hit the end of the amputated leg, they&#39;re picked up by a pair of sensors embedded in the surrounding muscle tissue. These sensors, in turn, send a wireless signal to the Proprio foot telling it to flex or extend. And since the muscles themselves aren&#39;t contracting, there&#39;s no lag between thinking about moving and actually doing so. What&#39;s more, the implantation surgery only takes about 15 minutes and requires an single single-centimeter-long incision. Even cooler is the fact that the sensors are powered by tiny magnetic coils housed in the prosthetic socket so they won&#39;t have to be replaced once installed. &quot;We believe this is a lifelong sensor,&quot; Thorvaldur Ingvarsson, Ossur&#39;s head of R&amp;D, told <a href=\"http://www.popsci.com/brain-controlled-bionic-legs-are-here-no-really\"><em>Popular Science</em></a>.</p>\n\n<p>\"It's really surreal,\" Gudmundur Olafsson, one of the the company's two initial test subjects, said in a statement. \"The first time, to be honest, I started to cry. You are moving the ankle, and I basically haven't had one in 11 years.\" Olafsson spent 14 months using the IMES-enabled Proprio as his sole prosthetic.</p>\n\n<p>Up next, the company plans to hold large-scale clinical trials and hopes to have the device to market within the next three to five years. There's no word yet on how much the devices will cost once they do become available.</p>\n<p>Filed under: <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/category/wearables/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\" rel=\"tag\">Wearables</a>, <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/category/wireless/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\" rel=\"tag\">Wireless</a>, <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/category/science/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\" rel=\"tag\">Science</a></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2015/05/20/prosthetic-foot-mind-control/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget#comments\">Comments</a></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.popsci.com/brain-controlled-bionic-legs-are-here-no-really\">Popular Science</a></p>",

Yahoo and Georgia Tech researchers have <a href=\"http://yahoolabs.tumblr.com/post/119448741621/how-photo-filters-affect-online-engagement?soc_src=mail&amp;soc_trk=ma\">learned</a> that filtered photos (at least, on <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2015/05/07/flickr-builds-powerful-photo-search-engine-in-major-redesign/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\">Flickr</a>) are 21 percent more likely to get views, and 45 percent more likely to receive comments.  This doesn't mean that you can throw on any effect you like, mind you.  Warmer-looking filters usually get the best results, while colder examples have less of an impact.  In short, feel free to tweak your Instagram shots if you feel they lack a certain oomph that will draw in the crowds -- just don't try to be overly dark and edgy.</p>\n\n<p>Filed under: <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/category/cellphones/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\" rel=\"tag\">Cellphones</a>, <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/category/cameras/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\" rel=\"tag\">Cameras</a>, <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/category/internet/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\" rel=\"tag\">Internet</a>, <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/category/mobile/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\" rel=\"tag\">Mobile</a></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2015/05/20/photo-filter-study/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget#comments\">Comments</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Via:</strong> <a href=\"http://petapixel.com/2015/05/20/filtered-photos-are-21-more-likely-to-be-viewed/\">PetaPixel</a></p>\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href=\"http://yahoolabs.tumblr.com/post/119448741621/how-photo-filters-affect-online-engagement?soc_src=mail&amp;soc_trk=ma\">Yahoo Labs (Tumblr)</a></p>",

These are the first products Google has released under its new Editions project, a series of collaborations with artists to develop limited edition \"live cases\" for select Android phones. For this batch, Mountain View worked with electronic dance music producer/DJ <a href=\"http://www.joystiq.com/2014/03/15/skrillex-advergame-takes-dubstep-to-the-stars/\">Skrillex</a>, who designed an outer space-inspired set. Now, here's the cool part: in keeping with the space theme, the products come with live wallpapers showing images of the Earth from the stratosphere during the day and constellations visible from your location at night. The tech giant actually launched a high-altitude balloon named after Skrillex's dog Nanou to capture images of our planet and didn't just take images from NASA.\n\n<p></p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center\"><iframe allowFullScreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"384\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/4x8_95bXTTE?rel=0&amp;wmode=opaque\" width=\"630\"></iframe></div>\n\n<p>In addition, the cases are built with a shortcut button -- it leads to the DJ's YouTube feed out of the box, but you can reprogram it to launch the camera or any other specific app. The Skrillex Editions cases are now up for sale on <a href=\"https://store.google.com/magazine/skrillex_live_case_magazine?utm_source=Google&amp;utm_medium=Blog&amp;utm_content=Android&amp;utm_campaign=LaunchDay\">Google Store</a> for the <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/lg/nexus/5/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\">Nexus 5</a>, <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/motorola/nexus/6/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\">Nexus 6</a>, <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/samsung/galaxy/s5/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\">Samsung Galaxy S5</a>, <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/samsung/galaxy/s6/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\">Samsung Galaxy S6</a> and <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/samsung/galaxy/note/4/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\">Samsung Galaxy Note 4</a>.

Two new studies may further confuse you about the benefits, with one concluding that gaming makes you friendlier in the real world, and another implying it could <em>ruin your brain</em>. First the plus side: <a href=\"http://today.ttu.edu/posts/2015/05/cooperative-video-game-play-elicits-pro-social-behavior\">Texas Tech</a> researchers think that cooperative gameplay, whether in violent or non-violent games, makes people nicer. \"We found that playing with a helpful partner increases the expectation of others to reciprocate that pro-social behavior,\" said author John Velez. He added that teaming up even makes you \"nicer to the other team... that just tried to beat you.\"</p>\n<p>Playing cooperatively, rather than alone -- even online -- can stimulate gamers' empathy so much that it negates the aggressive effects of violent games and even carries over into the real world. Velez found that players were more likely to help out pals in social situations and less likely to be <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2015/01/21/crash-ooverride-anti-gamergate/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\">hostile</a> to friend and foe alike. \"What we found was cooperative play seems to have the biggest effect in terms of decreasing aggression toward other people,\" he said.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>What we found was cooperative play seems to have the biggest effect in terms of decreasing aggression toward other people.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>On the downside, because of the way that gaming stimulates your brain, it may increase your risk to neurological disorders like Alzheimer&#39;s Disease. Researchers from the Douglas Institute and Université de Montréal <a href=\"http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2015-05/dmhu-ssn051915.php\">found</a> that gamers tend to navigate their environment using the brain's reward center (the caudate nucleas), rather than using spatial memory from the hippocampus like non-gamers. The results were hardly conclusive, and the team said that further studies should focus on specific games. But the study shows that while gaming may make you more <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2010/12/20/132077565/video-games-boost-brain-power-multitasking-skills\">attentive visually</a>, that might be outweighed by the negative effects on your brain.</p>\n<p>Filed under: <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/category/gaming/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\" rel=\"tag\">Gaming</a></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2015/05/20/gaming-cooperatively-makes-you-more-sociable/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget#comments\">Comments</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Via:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/05/150508105656.htm\">Science Daily</a></p>\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href=\"http://today.ttu.edu/posts/2015/05/cooperative-video-game-play-elicits-pro-social-behavior\">Texas Tech University</a>, <a href=\"http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2015-05/dmhu-ssn051915.php\">EurekAlert</a></p>",

Yes and no, if you ask <em>NPR</em>. The outlet <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/sections/money/2015/05/20/406484294/an-npr-reporter-raced-a-machine-to-write-a-news-story-who-won\">held a showdown</a> between Automated Insights' WordSmith news generator and a seasoned reporter to see which of the two could not only finish an earnings story the quickest, but produce something you'd <em>want</em> to read. The results? WordSmith was much faster, producing its piece in two minutes versus seven, but the writing was more than a little stiff -- it lacked the colorful expressions that made <em>NPR</em>&#39;s version easy to digest. With that said, newsies might not want to relax just yet. It&#39;s technically possible for software to adapt to a given style, so flesh-and-bone writers may still want to update their resumés... y&#39;know, just in case.</p>\n\n<p>[Image credit: Justin Cook, <em>NPR</em>]</p>\n<p align=\"center\"></p>\n<p>Filed under: <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/category/software/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\" rel=\"tag\">Software</a></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2015/05/20/robotic-news-writer-showdown/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget#comments\">Comments</a></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/sections/money/2015/05/20/406484294/an-npr-reporter-raced-a-machine-to-write-a-news-story-who-won\">NPR</a></p>",

The act disrupted more than 50 schools, bringing everything from payroll to standardized tests grinding to a halt.

If found guilty, the unnamed individual is likely to serve up to 180 days in jail, as well as being expelled from school. In addition, the suspect's parents are going to be asked to pay for the financial losses suffered as a consequence of the attack. At the same time, a middle school student is also under investigation for attempting a similar attack shortly afterward.

Gamers especially flocked to the frame rate as it allowed for jutter-free playback of fast-paced titles like <em><a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2015/04/09/call-of-duty-black-ops-3-teaser/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\">Call of Duty</a></em> or<em> <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2015/03/13/titanfall-sequel-headed-to-more-than-just-xbox-and-windows/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\">Titanfall</a></em>.

The new frame rate is still an early preview, mind you, and will only be available on HTML5-compatible browsers. However, YouTube will encode these streams in both 720p60 and 1080p60 formats as well as automatically knock it down to 30FPS for devices that can't handle full speed.</p>\n\n<div></div>\nWhat's more, YouTube is also rolling out HTML5 playback which will enable viewers to not only rewind in the middle of a live stream but also play it back at up to double speed in order to catch back up to the broadcast. And for producers, the video-sharing site has collaborated with Elgato and XSplit to ensure that products like <a href=\"https://www.elgato.com/gaming/download\">Elgato Game Capture</a>, <a href=\"https://www.xsplit.com/blog/xsplit-broadcaster-and-xsplit-gamecaster-v2-3-are-now-available\">XSplit Broadcaster</a> and <a href=\"https://www.xsplit.com/blog/xsplit-broadcaster-and-xsplit-gamecaster-v2-3-are-now-available\">XSplit Gamecaster</a> will continue to work with the site.\n<p>Filed under: <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/category/displays/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\" rel=\"tag\">Displays</a>, <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/category/google/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\" rel=\"tag\">Google</a></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2015/05/21/youtube-now-supports-60-fps-live-streaming/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget#comments\">Comments</a></strong></p>",

It'll include new morsels of <em>SpongeBob Squarepants</em>, <em>Dora the Explorer</em> and <em>Ben 10</em>, as well as cult favourite <em>Adventure Time</em>.

Together with Google, it launched Code as a Second Language (CSL) courses in eight cities, including New York, Las Angeles and Miami. The idea is to introduce students to coding through 1-2 hour sessions, then steer them to the <a href=\"http://www.loftcsl.org/\">LOFT</a> (Latinos on Fast Track) network for ongoing online instruction. Students who complete that training could later be granted internships and possibly full-time positions with Fortune 500 companies.</p>\n<p>Volunteers or teachers learn to train kids on basic coding through a program called CS First. Google and the HHF plan to implement the CSL program in 30 additional LA schools later on, and launch pilot CSL programs at the Mexican consulates in San Jose and Washington, DC. Meanwhile, schools interested in the program can sign up <a href=\"http://www.loftcsl.org/school_signup\">here</a>, and volunteers instructors can enlist at <a href=\"http://www.loftcsl.org/volunteer_signup\">this link</a>.

From today, customers in Manhattan, <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2014/12/18/amazon-prime-now/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\">the company's first Prime Now location</a>, can shop at a number of local businesses and have fresh food delivered within 60 minutes. D'Agostino, Gourmet Garage and Billy's Bakery are the first companies on board, offering groceries, cooked meals and freshly baked cupcakes respectively alongside Amazon's own range of goods. The online retailer is starting small but plans to add more stores across Manhattan over time, with Italian food market Eataly and Westside Market already waiting in the wings. As before, Prime Now's one-hour deliveries cost $7.99, so be sure to factor that in before impulse buying those delicious treats.</p>\n\n<p>Filed under: <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/category/household/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\" rel=\"tag\">Household</a>, <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/category/internet/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\" rel=\"tag\">Internet</a>, <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/category/mobile/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\" rel=\"tag\">Mobile</a>, <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/category/amazon/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\" rel=\"tag\">Amazon</a></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2015/05/21/amazons-one-hour-delivery-service-now-features-local-stores/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget#comments\">Comments</a></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20150521005405/en/Prime-One-Hour-Delivery-Favorite-Local-Stores#.VV2FPBPF9Cc\">Amazon (Businesswire)</a></p>",

Well apparently, that kind of face-tracking tech already exists. Facebook's <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2015/05/19/oculus-mobile-jam-vr-finalists/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\">Oculus division</a> has teamed up with University of Southern California researchers to develop a way to track your facial expressions while wearing a <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2015/05/06/early-2016-oculus-rift-consumer/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\">chunky VR headset</a>. What they did was insert strain gauges within the the Rift's foam padding to monitor the movements of the upper part of your face. To monitor the lower part not covered by the headset, they attached a 3D camera to a short boom clipped to the center of the Rift. As you can see in the video below the fold, a virtual avatar successfully mimicked the expressions of their testers with that setup.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center\"><iframe allowFullScreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"384\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/rgKkEnaaSDc?rel=0&amp;wmode=opaque\" width=\"630\"></iframe></div>\n\n<p>Project lead Hao Li believes the technology could make it more compelling to interact with others in virtual words; talking face to face, even as avatars, feels a lot more personal than text chats, after all.

Researchers at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory have <a href=\"https://www.llnl.gov/news/american-energy-use-slightly-carbon-emissions-almost-unchanged-0\">determined</a> that Americans' energy use climbed 1 percent year-over-year in 2014, but its carbon emissions hardly budged at all. In fact, they were down significantly for coal and petroleum-based power. While some of that decline is due to industry using less-than-clean natural gas, it's also helped by big jumps in <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2015/05/09/current-solar-power-tech-is-good-enough/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\">solar</a> and <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2015/01/16/new-york-city-wind-turbine/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\">wind</a> energy, which respectively grew by 33 and 8 percent.</p>\n<p>These eco-friendly sources still represent just a tiny piece of the puzzle at 2.2 percent of the US' entire demand, so there's no doubt that dirty power still dominates. Scientists are quick to add that green tech is running into roadblocks, as well -- wind turbine deployments have slowed down in the past two years, and California's drought shrank the use of hydroelectric power. All the same, it's evident that environmentally conscious electricity is significant enough to mitigate the US' damage to the planet.</p>\n\n<p>[Image credit: AP Photo/John Raoux]</p>\n<p>Filed under: <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/category/science/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\" rel=\"tag\">Science</a></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2015/05/21/us-study-shows-green-power-effect/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget#comments\">Comments</a></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.llnl.gov/news/american-energy-use-slightly-carbon-emissions-almost-unchanged-0\">Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory</a></p>",

Even so, it's good to see that future connected drones will be built from the start with network security in mind.</p>\n\n<p>[Image credit: AP Photo/Steve Helber]</p>\n<p>Filed under: <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/category/robots/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\" rel=\"tag\">Robots</a></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2015/05/20/us-navy-wants-hack-resistant-drones/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget#comments\">Comments</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Via:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.nextgov.com/cybersecurity/2015/05/who-knows-if-navy-drones-and-airborne-weapons-are-hackable/113134/?oref=ng-HPtopstory\">Nextgov</a>, <a href=\"http://www.defenseone.com/technology/2015/05/navy-trying-hack-proof-its-drones/113311/\">Defense One</a></p>\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;id=6dd007eb4561583a583d66658e8f3c16&amp;tab=core&amp;_cview=0\">FedBizOpps.gov</a></p>",

And while Lycos hasn't made many headlines lately, the company still maintains an impressive portfolio of technology patents. Its patents are wide-ranging enough that Google already got into trouble over old Lycos tech <a href=\"http://hamptonroads.com/2012/11/norfolk-jury-awards-30-million-small-tech-company\">back in 2012</a> before winning its case on an appeal <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-08-15/vringo-loses-appeals-court-ruling-in-google-patent-case-1-\">last year</a>.

The technology, known as an Implanted MyoElectric Sensor (IMES) will allow users to move the company's motorized Proprio Foot just like they do <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2015/04/01/thinking-cap-controls-prosthetic-arm-with-thoughts-not-surger/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\">the real thing</a>.</p>\n<p>With an existing analog (or even powered) prosthesis, there&#39;s often an infuriating lag between intention and action because the user has to physically contract a muscle to activate it. Not so with the IMES system. When electrical signals from the user&#39;s brain hit the end of the amputated leg, they&#39;re picked up by a pair of sensors embedded in the surrounding muscle tissue. These sensors, in turn, send a wireless signal to the Proprio foot telling it to flex or extend. And since the muscles themselves aren&#39;t contracting, there&#39;s no lag between thinking about moving and actually doing so. What&#39;s more, the implantation surgery only takes about 15 minutes and requires an single single-centimeter-long incision. Even cooler is the fact that the sensors are powered by tiny magnetic coils housed in the prosthetic socket so they won&#39;t have to be replaced once installed. &quot;We believe this is a lifelong sensor,&quot; Thorvaldur Ingvarsson, Ossur&#39;s head of R&amp;D, told <a href=\"http://www.popsci.com/brain-controlled-bionic-legs-are-here-no-really\"><em>Popular Science</em></a>.</p>\n\n<p>\"It's really surreal,\" Gudmundur Olafsson, one of the the company's two initial test subjects, said in a statement. \"The first time, to be honest, I started to cry. You are moving the ankle, and I basically haven't had one in 11 years.\" Olafsson spent 14 months using the IMES-enabled Proprio as his sole prosthetic.</p>\n\n<p>Up next, the company plans to hold large-scale clinical trials and hopes to have the device to market within the next three to five years. There's no word yet on how much the devices will cost once they do become available.</p>\n<p>Filed under: <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/category/wearables/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\" rel=\"tag\">Wearables</a>, <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/category/wireless/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\" rel=\"tag\">Wireless</a>, <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/category/science/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\" rel=\"tag\">Science</a></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2015/05/20/prosthetic-foot-mind-control/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget#comments\">Comments</a></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.popsci.com/brain-controlled-bionic-legs-are-here-no-really\">Popular Science</a></p>",

This doesn't mean that you can throw on any effect you like, mind you.  Warmer-looking filters usually get the best results, while colder examples have less of an impact.

These are the first products Google has released under its new Editions project, a series of collaborations with artists to develop limited edition \"live cases\" for select Android phones. For this batch, Mountain View worked with electronic dance music producer/DJ <a href=\"http://www.joystiq.com/2014/03/15/skrillex-advergame-takes-dubstep-to-the-stars/\">Skrillex</a>, who designed an outer space-inspired set. Now, here's the cool part: in keeping with the space theme, the products come with live wallpapers showing images of the Earth from the stratosphere during the day and constellations visible from your location at night. The tech giant actually launched a high-altitude balloon named after Skrillex's dog Nanou to capture images of our planet and didn't just take images from NASA.\n\n<p></p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center\"><iframe allowFullScreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"384\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/4x8_95bXTTE?rel=0&amp;wmode=opaque\" width=\"630\"></iframe></div>\n\n<p>In addition, the cases are built with a shortcut button -- it leads to the DJ's YouTube feed out of the box, but you can reprogram it to launch the camera or any other specific app. The Skrillex Editions cases are now up for sale on <a href=\"https://store.google.com/magazine/skrillex_live_case_magazine?utm_source=Google&amp;utm_medium=Blog&amp;utm_content=Android&amp;utm_campaign=LaunchDay\">Google Store</a> for the <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/lg/nexus/5/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\">Nexus 5</a>, <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/motorola/nexus/6/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\">Nexus 6</a>, <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/samsung/galaxy/s5/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\">Samsung Galaxy S5</a>, <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/samsung/galaxy/s6/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\">Samsung Galaxy S6</a> and <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/products/samsung/galaxy/note/4/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\">Samsung Galaxy Note 4</a>.

Two new studies may further confuse you about the benefits, with one concluding that gaming makes you friendlier in the real world, and another implying it could <em>ruin your brain</em>. First the plus side: <a href=\"http://today.ttu.edu/posts/2015/05/cooperative-video-game-play-elicits-pro-social-behavior\">Texas Tech</a> researchers think that cooperative gameplay, whether in violent or non-violent games, makes people nicer. \"We found that playing with a helpful partner increases the expectation of others to reciprocate that pro-social behavior,\" said author John Velez. He added that teaming up even makes you \"nicer to the other team... that just tried to beat you.\"</p>\n<p>Playing cooperatively, rather than alone -- even online -- can stimulate gamers' empathy so much that it negates the aggressive effects of violent games and even carries over into the real world. Velez found that players were more likely to help out pals in social situations and less likely to be <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2015/01/21/crash-ooverride-anti-gamergate/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\">hostile</a> to friend and foe alike. \"What we found was cooperative play seems to have the biggest effect in terms of decreasing aggression toward other people,\" he said.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>What we found was cooperative play seems to have the biggest effect in terms of decreasing aggression toward other people.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>On the downside, because of the way that gaming stimulates your brain, it may increase your risk to neurological disorders like Alzheimer&#39;s Disease. Researchers from the Douglas Institute and Université de Montréal <a href=\"http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2015-05/dmhu-ssn051915.php\">found</a> that gamers tend to navigate their environment using the brain's reward center (the caudate nucleas), rather than using spatial memory from the hippocampus like non-gamers. The results were hardly conclusive, and the team said that further studies should focus on specific games. But the study shows that while gaming may make you more <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2010/12/20/132077565/video-games-boost-brain-power-multitasking-skills\">attentive visually</a>, that might be outweighed by the negative effects on your brain.</p>\n<p>Filed under: <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/category/gaming/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\" rel=\"tag\">Gaming</a></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2015/05/20/gaming-cooperatively-makes-you-more-sociable/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget#comments\">Comments</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Via:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/05/150508105656.htm\">Science Daily</a></p>\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href=\"http://today.ttu.edu/posts/2015/05/cooperative-video-game-play-elicits-pro-social-behavior\">Texas Tech University</a>, <a href=\"http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2015-05/dmhu-ssn051915.php\">EurekAlert</a></p>",

The results? WordSmith was much faster, producing its piece in two minutes versus seven, but the writing was more than a little stiff -- it lacked the colorful expressions that made <em>NPR</em>&#39;s version easy to digest. With that said, newsies might not want to relax just yet.

The act disrupted more than 50 schools, bringing everything from payroll to standardized tests grinding to a halt.

If found guilty, the unnamed individual is likely to serve up to 180 days in jail, as well as being expelled from school. In addition, the suspect's parents are going to be asked to pay for the financial losses suffered as a consequence of the attack. At the same time, a middle school student is also under investigation for attempting a similar attack shortly afterward.

But is the underlying CDMA network going to go away, too?   Not for a long while, the carrier's <a href=\"http://www.rcrwireless.com/20150519/carriers/cdma-remains-on-verizon-wireless-radar-600-mhz-auction-strategy-in-flux-tag2\">Fran Shammo says</a>.  He explains that CDMA will hang around for \"<a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2015/04/07/intel-atom-x3-sofia-iot/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\">internet of things</a>\" devices (think appliances, cars and machinery), which need only \"small bursts\" of data to communicate.  The newer LTE network is still top priority -- eventually, all of Verizon's cellphones will depend on it -- but it won't completely replace the older technology for quite some time.</p>\n\n<p>[Image credit: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images]</p>\n\n<p>Filed under: <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/category/cellphones/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\" rel=\"tag\">Cellphones</a>, <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/category/wireless/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\" rel=\"tag\">Wireless</a>, <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/category/mobile/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\" rel=\"tag\">Mobile</a>, <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/category/verizon/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\" rel=\"tag\">Verizon</a></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2015/05/20/verizon-cdma-will-remain-for-iot/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget#comments\">Comments</a></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.rcrwireless.com/20150519/carriers/cdma-remains-on-verizon-wireless-radar-600-mhz-auction-strategy-in-flux-tag2\">RCRWireless</a></p>",

But, starting today, those of you in the US and Canada will have the chance to get even more out of it. Microsoft has announced that the official <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2015/04/08/the-xbox-one-tunes-in-to-free-ota-tv-in-the-us-and-canada/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\">TV tuner for its Xbox One</a>, which lets people watch over-the-air channels directly from the console, <a href=\"http://news.xbox.com/2015/05/xbox-one-tv-tuner-general-availability\">is now available</a> in these two countries.
