Well it is, but internationally Sony wants it to be known as the Xperia Z3+. Truth be told, that's a more appropriate name for the phone, given the incremental upgrade it represents over last year's model. The Z3+ may look virtually identical to its predecessor, but internally it has almost everything you'd expect from a 2015 flagship.</p>\n\n<p></p>\n<p>Let's start with what hasn't changed: the 5.2-inch 1080p IPS display. Our <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2014/10/06/sony-xperia-z3-review/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\">review of the Z3</a> found it to be excellent, and HTC also stuck with its 1080p unit this year, but there's no hiding from the fact that Samsung and LG have higher resolution units in their latest flagships. The Z3's 20.7-megapixel main camera is also carried over, with Sony focusing its attention on an all-new 5-megapixel selfie cam, which represents a solid upgrade from last year's 2-megapixel shooter.</p>\n\n<p>As you'd expect, the Z3+ is powered by Qualcomm's best, the <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2014/12/12/snapdragon-810-hands-on/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\">octa-core Snapdragon 810 processor</a> paired with 3GB of RAM, which should keep Android 5.0 chugging away nicely when compared to the Z3's 801. In order to reduce the Z3+'s dimensions (it's 6.9mm thick, compared to 7.3mm last year) the battery has been cut from 3,100Ah to 2,900mAh. Hopefully the 810's four low-power cores will mean that reduction won't affect real-world battery life -- Sony isn't sharing usage figures yet, only declaring \"up to two-day battery life.\"</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Xperia Z3+ charging port\" src=\"http://o.aolcdn.com/hss/storage/midas/3b84d9ca3b648df259b82435864c4d30/202040189/Xperia+Z3%2B_charge_630.jpg\"></p>\n\n<p>You probably noticed already just how similar the Z3+ looks to the Z3, but there's one change worth talking about. The micro-USB port has moved from the top left, down to the bottom of the phone -- no longer hidden behind a fiddly cap. Sony says this new capless port doesn't affect the phone's IP65/68 dust and waterproofing certifications. The magnetic charging pins, which used to live just below the charging port, have also been removed in pursuit of \"an overall more seamless and minimalist design.\"</p>\n\n<p>The Z3+ will be available this summer at an unknown price -- we'd imagine it'll sell for about the same as the Z3 at launch. Last year's model was very well received, but Sony was still blown away by its competitors in terms of sales. Given Sony's two most-prominent rivals in the west, Samsung and Apple, have taken big leaps forward with the S6, S6 Edge, iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, it's difficult to see the Z3+ making much of a dent in either's profits. Sony is in a holding pattern with its smartphone business. It needed to do something big with this latest flagship, but is instead offering yet another moderate upgrade. Maybe next year.</p>\n<p>Filed under: <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/category/mobile/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\" rel=\"tag\">Mobile</a>, <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/category/sony/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\" rel=\"tag\">Sony</a></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2015/05/26/sony-xperia-z3-plus/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget#comments\">Comments</a></strong></p>",

The <em>Detroit Free Press</em> <a href=\"http://www.freep.com/story/money/2015/05/19/general-motors-chevrolet-volt/27572767/\">reports</a> that there were roughly 6,000 unsold 2015 Volts as of April, or more than twice the 2,779 that sold in the first four months of the year. Sales are down 46 percent versus the same period a year ago, and dealers appear willing to make some serious concessions to clinch a deal. While the 2015 Volt officially carries a $34,345 sticker price before tax credits, the TrueCar price guide shows that buyers are typically paying $30,607 -- quite the discount if you're looking for an extra-efficient ride.</p>\nThe backlog isn't surprising, especially as there are signs that the market for eco-friendly transportation is shifting toward pure electric vehicles.

A bevy of sensors have been rigged up inside, including a laser scanner, video cameras, ultrasonic and radar detectors. All of the environmental data is then fed through Audi's \"<a href=\"http://www.audi.com/com/brand/en/vorsprung_durch_technik/content/2014/10/zentrales-fahrerassistenzsteuergeraet-zfas.html\">zFAS</a>\" driver assistance system, which ultimately dictates how the concept car behaves on the road. It's not the first time Audi has experimented with <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2014/12/18/audi-self-driving-rs-7-concept-test-drive/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\">autonomous</a> and <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2015/03/04/audi-q7-r8-hybrid-electric-vehicle/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\">electric vehicles</a>, but it's still hard to ignore this beautiful combination of the two.

He'll still oversee the company's broader design efforts, but there will be leaders dedicated to user interfaces (Alan Dye) and industrial design (Richard Howarth) <a href=\"http://9to5mac.com/2015/05/25/jony-ive-chief-design-officer/\">as of July 1st</a>.</p>\n<p>As Ive explains, the move \"frees [him] up\" from the drudgery of management and lets him focus on... well, design. It's not entirely shocking, though, given the workload the exec has had as of late. He's had a hand in most of what Apple sells, and even <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/23/shape-things-come\">helped shape</a> the company's <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2013/11/20/apple-spaceship-campus-cupertino/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\">upcoming \"spaceship\" campus</a>. The CDO role is arguably as much about giving Ive room to breathe as anything else -- he doesn't have to worry so much about splitting his attention in several different directions.</p>\n\n<p>This won't necessarily lead to a big shift in how Apple crafts its products. Dye helped Ive build the interface team that came after <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2012/10/29/apple-executive-shakeup-scott-forstall-and-john-browett-out/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\">Scott Forstall's forced exit</a> from the company, while Howarth has been instrumental to designing the iPhone and numerous other pieces of hardware. The big difference is that these newly minted executives have considerably more sway, and Ive might not be as directly involved with their work as he used to be.</p>\n\n<p>[Image credit: Kimberly White/Getty Images for Vanity Fair]</p>\n<p>Filed under: <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/category/cellphones/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\" rel=\"tag\">Cellphones</a>, <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/category/desktops/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\" rel=\"tag\">Desktops</a>, <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/category/laptops/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\" rel=\"tag\">Laptops</a>, <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/category/tablets/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\" rel=\"tag\">Tablets</a>, <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/category/wearables/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\" rel=\"tag\">Wearables</a>, <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/category/mobile/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\" rel=\"tag\">Mobile</a>, <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/category/apple/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\" rel=\"tag\">Apple</a></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2015/05/25/apple-names-jony-ive-chief-design-officer/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget#comments\">Comments</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Via:</strong> <a href=\"http://9to5mac.com/2015/05/25/jony-ive-chief-design-officer/\">9to5Mac</a></p>\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/apple/11628710/When-Stephen-Fry-met-Jony-Ive-the-self-confessed-fanboi-meets-Apples-newly-promoted-chief-design-officer.html\">The Telegraph</a></p>",

UC Berkeley's <a href=\"http://newscenter.berkeley.edu/2015/05/21/deep-learning-robot-masters-skills-via-trial-and-error/\">BRETT</a> (Berkeley Robot for the Elimination of Tedious Tasks) isn't nearly that dependent, however.  The machine uses neural network-based <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2014/09/25/neighborhood-algorithm/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\">deep learning</a> algorithms to master tasks through trial and error, much like humans do.  Ask it to assemble a toy and it'll keep trying until it understands what works.  In theory, you'd rarely need to give the robot new code -- you'd just make requests and give the automaton enough time to figure things out.</p>\n<p>As you might suspect, though, this brain-like 'bot isn't ready for the real world yet.  It takes 10 minutes to learn a task when you tell it exactly where it needs to start and stop, and 3 hours if it has to learn those positions itself.  BRETT isn't drawing from a wealth of experience, as you do, so it doesn't make those logical leaps that help you grasp a concept quickly.  With that in mind, the researchers are optimistic that the technology will improve dramatically over the next several years as robots get better at handling lots of data.  Eventually, artificial intelligence could be good enough that robots would be ready for anything their designs allow.</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\"><iframe allowFullScreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"354\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/JeVppkoloXs?rel=0&amp;wmode=opaque\" width=\"630\"></iframe></p>\n<p>Filed under: <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/category/robots/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\" rel=\"tag\">Robots</a>, <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/category/science/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\" rel=\"tag\">Science</a></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2015/05/25/brett-deep-learning-robot/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget#comments\">Comments</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Via:</strong> <a href=\"http://gizmodo.com/this-robot-learns-new-tasks-by-doing-them-like-a-human-1706567578\">Gizmodo</a>, <a href=\"http://www.slashgear.com/uc-berkley-robot-learns-from-trial-and-error-just-like-us-25385087/\">SlashGear</a></p>\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href=\"http://newscenter.berkeley.edu/2015/05/21/deep-learning-robot-masters-skills-via-trial-and-error/\">UC Berkeley</a></p>",

Oculus wants to change that.</p>\n<p>Recently, I was invited to watch <em>Lost Director's Cut, </em>a<em> </em>slightly modified version of the film that debuted in January. What's different here is a new social component, which the Story Studio team calls a \"shared experience.\" Essentially, this allows two viewers (or more), each wearing <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2015/05/06/early-2016-oculus-rift-consumer/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\">an Oculus headset</a>, to be a part of the same world and explore it simultaneously. In the case of <em>Lost Director's Cut</em>, the person giving the demo and I were both fireflies in the movie; we could look at each other or fly closer toward one another, all while a scene was taking place next to us. It's breathtaking and weird at the same time, and that's a good thing.</p>\n\n<center><img src=\"http://o.aolcdn.com/hss/storage/midas/9b22b2243bfaabea585296d45f716149/202032782/LostTitle.png\" alt=\"\"><i><small> </small></i></center>\n\n<center><i><small>An opening credit for </small></i><small>Lost</small><i><small>,' Oculus Story Studio's first short film.</small></i></center>\n<br>\n \n<p>\"VR is very isolationist: You put it on and you forget your surroundings; you forget the people around you,\" says Max Planck, <a href=\"https://www.oculus.com/storystudio/\">Story Studio's</a> supervising technical director. \"We wanna tell stories that people can come out of it together and have water-cooler moments.\" He adds, \"Like you're around the campfire and someone's telling you a story, or you go to a movie or a theater performance and you see it with other people, and you come out of it and you want to talk with people.\" Planck and his team say the goal is to show filmmakers how far they can go with VR, so that they're not just thinking about creating single-person experiences. As it stands, there's only a handful of projects that have a social angle -- things like <em><a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2014/01/21/oculus-rift-gender-swap-aims-to-unravel-identity-intimacy-resp/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\">The Machine to be Another</a>, </em>an art experiment that transports people into bodies of the opposite sex<i>. </i></p>\n\n<p>Edward Saatchi, a Story Studio producer, believes that virtual reality doesn't have to be isolated, but instead can feel like something you can do with your friends, where you talk to each other and discover VR worlds together. <i>\"</i>We've heard so much: 'Well, how is this gonna interact with cinema? Cinema is so social. There's people in a cinema; you are together.' So we wanted to give a hint of where we think the future of VR in cinema is,\" he says. \"We think the future of VR in cinema is social, that you're with your friends. You're not in the same room, maybe; maybe you're all going in together at the same time, and that's where the lines between cinema and an MMO [massive multiplayer online] start to blur.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\">\"So we wanted to give a hint of where we think the future of VR in cinema is.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><em>Lost Director's Cut </em>is also enhanced by <a href=\"https://www.oculus.com/\">Oculus' </a>newly developed sound engine, dubbed Spatial Audio, which lets you hear elements of the film based on the direction they're coming from. At one point, for instance, a bird flies over your head and you're able to hear the sound of it coming toward you, just as it goes into the background. \"A<span>ll those elements -- the firefly, the beeping, the hand -- as they move around are being attenuated so that if you close your eyes, listen for a sound and be like, 'It should be right in front of me,' there it is,\" says Planck about the film's adapted directional audio. \"VR needs that; VR is a big feedback system. Where I look, visuals and audio need to respond too.\" </span></p>\n\n<center><img src=\"http://o.aolcdn.com/hss/storage/midas/1a48faf069e873ee0026a253a04a8b3b/202029696/handlead.jpg\" alt=\"\"></center>\n\n<center><i><small>'The Hand'</small></i></center>\n<br>\n \n<p>Even so, Story Studio <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2014/12/11/oculus-nimble-vr/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\">is only scratching</a> the surface of <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2015/01/27/what-movies-do-you-want-to-see-in-virtual-reality/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\">this type of storytelling</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Saschka Unseld, who directed <em>Lost</em>, doesn't see anything wrong with VR being an unsocial platform, though. \"I think it actually has a strength.

The finer details of the buyout aren't available, but Charter would fold both its new acquisition and <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2015/03/31/charter-buys-bright-house/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\">Bright House</a> into a single mega-entity. Reportedly, Charter could announce the purchase as early as Tuesday -- if so, it's not wasting much time following <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2015/04/24/comcast-twc-merger-is-dead/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\">Comcast's failed TWC deal</a>.</p>\nNeither side is commenting on the rumor. However, a hasty buyout suggests that Charter is determined to challenge the biggest US telecom giants. The real question is whether or not regulators will be any more favorable to this attempt at snapping up TWC. Charter isn't as big as Comcast, but an acquisition would still reduce the number of big competitors and give the remaining rivals more sway when negotiating TV and internet deals.\n<p>Filed under: <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/category/home-entertainment/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\" rel=\"tag\">Home Entertainment</a>, <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/category/internet/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\" rel=\"tag\">Internet</a>, <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/category/hd/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\" rel=\"tag\">HD</a></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2015/05/25/charter-near-buying-time-warner-cable/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget#comments\">Comments</a></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-05-25/charter-said-to-near-deal-for-time-warner-cable-at-195-a-share\">Bloomberg</a></p>",

The tiny country levies a much smaller rate of tax than most of the countries in which the retailer operates, allowing it to keep a larger share of sales. With the European Commission <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2014/10/07/amazon-luxembourg-european-commission-state-aid-tax-probe/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\">breathing down its neck</a> over claims it had agreed an illegal tax deal with Luxembourg, Amazon has quietly begun booking sales in some of its biggest European markets. <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-changes-tax-practices-in-europe-amid-investigations-1432480170\">According to the <em>Wall Street Journal</em></a>, the company began paying direct taxes on sales in the UK, Germany, Italy and Spain from May 1st.</p>\n<p>The move comes just as European governments are cracking down on tax practices employed by some of the world's biggest technology companies. In the UK, chancellor George Osbourne introduced a new law, <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2015/03/18/budget-technology-2015/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\">commonly referred to as the \"Google Tax\"</a>, in April to punish those diverting revenue overseas by imposing a 25 percent levy on their domestic profits. As a result, Apple, Google and Facebook are now required to report their earnings on a country-by-country basis.</p>\n\n<p>With Amazon making the first move, it'll put pressure on other major tech companies to follow suit. <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2013/05/28/apple-ceo-tim-cook-interview-at-d11-liveblog/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\">Despite claims to the contrary</a>, Apple has been accused of not paying its fair share of tax <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2014/06/11/ec-investigation-apple-tax/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\">in Ireland</a>, and Google has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/may/23/amazon-to-begin-paying-corporation-tax-on-uk-retail-sales\">previously been told by lawmakers</a> that its stance on tax is \"devious, calculated and unethical\". Amazon says that it began paving the way for the changes two years ago, but only now are plans coming into force.

Google has <a href=\"http://googleonlinesecurity.blogspot.ca/2015/05/new-research-some-tough-questions-for.html\">published research</a> showing that <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2014/09/03/the-only-way-to-make-your-icloud-security-questions-actually-sec/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\">security questions</a> aren't that secure at all. In many cases, your answers are straightforward enough that attackers stand a decent chance of getting them right in 10 guesses or less. And you probably don't want to use bogus answers to throw people off the scent, either. Many of those who try this strategy use common words and make it <em>easier</em> for someone to get in.</p>\n<p>So what's the alternative, then? Google doesn't think that multiple security questions would help, since that increases the chances that you'll forget at least one answer and lock yourself out. Instead, websites are better off using SMS-based reset codes, alternate email addresses and other methods that someone can't crack with a good guess. Thankfully, big sites like Google already do this -- the big challenge is getting your favorite store or social network to follow suit.</p>\n\n<p>[Image credit: AP Photo/Virginia Mayo]</p>\n<p>Filed under: <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/category/internet/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\" rel=\"tag\">Internet</a>, <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/category/google/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\" rel=\"tag\">Google</a></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2015/05/25/google-security-question-study/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget#comments\">Comments</a></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href=\"http://googleonlinesecurity.blogspot.com/2015/05/new-research-some-tough-questions-for.html\">Google Online Security Blog</a></p>",

Black silicon is far better suited to collecting sunlight at low angles, which is common in northern regions -- you wouldn't have to live in a sunny, forgiving part of the world to get the most out of clean energy. It should be cheaper, too. So long as these black cells translate well to mass production, you may have an easier time ditching the conventional power grid.</p>\n\n<p>Filed under: <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/category/science/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\" rel=\"tag\">Science</a></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2015/05/25/black-silicon-solar-cells-hit-record/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget#comments\">Comments</a></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.aalto.fi/en/current/news/2015-05-18-002/\">Aalto University</a>, <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nnano/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nnano.2015.89.html\">Nature</a></p>",

His work and life were turned into the film <em>A Beautiful Mind</em>, starring Russell Crowe, which won an Oscar for Best Picture in 2001, also putting focus on the stigma of mental illness. Nash's famed work in math and other fields extended beyond the game theory work that won him the Nobel Prize.</p>\n<p>Dr. Nash's work in cryptography was also ahead of its time: In 2011, the NSA <a href=\"https://agtb.wordpress.com/2012/02/17/john-nashs-letter-to-the-nsa/\">declassified letters</a> written by him in the 1950s, where he had anticipated many concepts of modern cryptography. John Nash was killed, with his wife Alicia, in a car crash on Saturday in New Jersey. He was returning from a trip to Norway where he had received the Abel prize, another high-ranking honor in mathematics.</p>\n<p>Filed under: <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/category/science/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\" rel=\"tag\">Science</a></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2015/05/24/john-nash/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget#comments\">Comments</a></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-32865248\">BBC</a></p>",

But the folks behind a new model on Kickstarter think that such UAVs have two big problems -- namely, they're hard to carry and break easily if you mess up. They built <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ascentaerosystems/sprite-the-portable-rugged-totally-different-small/description\">The Sprite</a> to overcome those limitations with a cylindrical, waterproof body and retractable blades. The design makes it easy to throw it into a pack, and when landing, the rotors halt in a half a second and fold into a retracted position. From there, the craft can safely alight on rocks, a bush or even a swamp without issues.</p>\n<p>Though the design looks more toy-like than something from, say, <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2015/04/13/3d-robotics-solo-smart-drone/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\">3D Robotics</a>, Sprite is actually targeting pros. It has fully autonomous flight using waypoint navigation and \"follow me\" modes, along with a built-in 1080p camera (with optional 3rd party FPV) and a 2-axis stabilized gimbal. You'll also get a GoPro compatible 2-axis gimbal that can be swapped without tools, and control via a smartphone, tablet, or optionally, an R/C transmitter. The current flight time is around 12 minutes with the LiPo batteries, but the makers are striving to improve that before it ships.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img src=\"http://o.aolcdn.com/hss/storage/midas/3515debe71dfd984874d6c4e939d8111/202034103/sprite-drone-2015-05-23-03.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>At $799 <em>sans</em> transmitter, the Sprite is targeting the mainstream semi-pro market. You'll need to pay an extra $150 for the transmitter and around $300 for first person view (FPV) capability, putting the sticker at $1,249 for the same capability as a $1,099 <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2015/04/08/dji-phantom-3-professional-4k-hands-on/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\">DJI Phantom 3</a> Advanced. In other words, you'll need to have faith not only in the concept, but also the company's ability to ship it. That said, it's well over half way to its $200,000 goal with 21 days to go, so it's more likely than not to get backed. If all goes well, delivery is slated for December 2015.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"473\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ascentaerosystems/sprite-the-portable-rugged-totally-different-small/widget/video.html\" width=\"631\"></iframe></p>\n<p>Filed under: <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/category/robots/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\" rel=\"tag\">Robots</a></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2015/05/24/sprite-drone-kickstarter/?utm_source=Feed_Classic_Full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;ncid=rss_full&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget#comments\">Comments</a></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ascentaerosystems/sprite-the-portable-rugged-totally-different-small\">Kickstarter</a></p>",

It's an accessory for an accessory, which sounds kind of ridiculous, but it's not like you have a lot of choices when it comes to adding gesture control to your gadget anyway. The remote control-like clip-on can access any feature you'd usually access through the touch screen or the watch dial, completely freeing up your other hand for tasks like eating, drinking or talking on the phone. Possible gestures include tapping, flicking your fingers, and closing and opening your hand -- you can configure it all through its companion app.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center\"><iframe allowFullScreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"384\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/D4IrLj-ApDs?rel=0&amp;wmode=opaque\" width=\"630\"></iframe></div>\n\n<p>Aria connects to a smartwatch via Bluetooth Low Energy, and it doesn't need a battery of its own.
